Thought of upgrade my laptop itself and realized that I have to spent 60K for the latest one. So decided to give chance for my old laptop by upgrading it's RAM and HDD.\n\nSince it's an old laptop it doesn't have a m.2 or nvme SSD slot in its board. So bought this 2.5"" SSD which will perfectly fit in my 2.5"" inch SATA HDD slot. I was in doubt when I bought this whether it will work or not. Trust me this thing worked like a charm.!!! Now my laptop is superfast (as compared to my old HDD) and windows 10 boots up in few seconds. And also launching apps accessing huge files became much much faster. Now I feel like it's a new laptop.!!!\n\nOnly problem was how to clone my old HDD and OS without loosing license and data. But crucial site has all the support you need. They have step by step videos to install and upgrade your old laptop. I am not a laptop mechanic, still am able to replace my HDD myself (see the pics). They have cloning software which is free for us(there are third-party sw which does the cloning but we have to pay). Very easy to upgrade by following those docs/videos.\n\nExtremely happy for this purchase. Saved my 50K (not required to buy new laptop)\n\nConclusion:\nIf you have a old laptop with slow HDD and you don't have plan to buy new laptop or looking for cheap solution, then go for this SSD.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1VpKrHONML._SY88.jpg,3,"upgrading old 2 . 5 "" sata hdd to ssd ? then go for it .","\ n i have an old laptop (8 yr old , 2013 model hp probook 4441s ) which lags now a days because of its slow spinning 5400rpm sata hdd . thought of upgrade my laptop itself and realized that i have to spent 60k for the latest one . so decided to give chance for my old laptop by upgrading it 's ram and hdd . \ n \ nsince it 's an old laptop it does n't have a m . 2 or nvme ssd slot in its board . so bought this 2 . 5 "" ssd which will perfectly fit in my 2 . 5 "" inch sata hdd slot . i was in doubt when i bought this whether it will work or not . trust me this thing worked like a charm . ! ! ! now my laptop is superfast ( as compared to my old hdd ) and windows 10 boots up in few seconds . and also launching apps accessing huge files became much much faster . now i feel like it 's a new laptop . ! ! ! \ n \ nonly problem was how to clone my old hdd and os without loosing license and data . but crucial site has all the support you need . they have step by step videos to install and upgrade your old laptop . i am not a laptop mechanic , still am able to replace my hdd myself ( see the pics ) . they have cloning software which is free for us ( there are third-party sw which does the cloning but we have to pay ) . very easy to upgrade by following those docs / videos . \ n \ nextremely happy for this purchase . saved my 50k ( not required to buy new laptop ) \ n \ nconclusion :\ nif you have a old laptop with slow hdd and you do n't have plan to buy new laptop or looking for cheap solution , then go for this ssd . \ n"

As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:\nPros:\nA great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]\nThe best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]\nSomewhere between great to excellent battery life\nThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDIC\nThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.\n\nCons:\nMany buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.\nYou will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.\nThe display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.\nAnd also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.\n\nConclusion with personal thoughts:\nOverall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.\n",1,sadness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AQCZRVGXL._SY88.jpg,4,overall a great phone just not a perfect one .,"\ n my mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try ios . as she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones [ previously lava red 5t ] i thought of advising her to go for iphone 11 . now coming to the phone or should i say iphone , it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties ; i 'll just list out a few points regarding the phone :\ npros :\ na great camera with realistic colors [ not highly saturated ] \ nthe best video recording on a mobile [ as of feb 2020 ] \ nsomewhere between great to excellent battery life \ nthe software experience is great if you 're into "" apple way "" of things and the whole experience is just fluidic \ nthe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it 's sides are alluminium and not steel . \ n \ ncons :\ nmany buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but i dont want to sugarcoat things ! the display is decent and not great ! in day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference , that is correct , but when you get into media apps like youtube , netflix , . . . etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution . there 's just no escaping that fact . \ nyou will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text . \ nthe display , in my opinion , would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she 's not a tech geek and she 's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone . \ nand also if you 're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop [ windows laptop ] this phone will frustrate you for sure . for this i will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process . \ n \ nconclusion with personal thoughts :\ noverall the phone is a great one if you 're not a tech geek and want the latest iphone . it 's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart tv . \ n"

No complaints for what I got for the price I paid\nSwitching from a 7 year old Sony 21"" to a Mi TV 43"", the change in both picture and audio quality is not just noticeable, it is in your face.\nI mean the audio sounds cheap and tinny. Even my JBL Bluetooth sounds better.\nThe image quality is just about suffer-able. Also if you are used to 1080p displays like on your phone, laptop, TV with much smaller screens, FHD on 43"" will give you a terrible experience especially with this TV that does ZERO anti-aliasing.I cant get past those pixel corners that are so clearly visible. If you don't understand what I am saying, look at the curve of 'M' in Mi when the TV boots up.\nBefore buying this TV i had read many review which mentioned losing WiFi connectivity or apps crashing when streaming full HD content. I myself noticed the same in one of my office TVs and attributed it to poor WiFi strength. But with this TV i can confirm that it is not the WiFi, I have a nighthawk gigabit router sitting less than 5 feet from the TV. When I connect the TV to ethernet, I dont see any more youtube crashes. So the wifi card in the TV is trashy cheap too and unable to handle heavy traffic.\nBoot-up time of the OS is not impressive either and takes ~60 seconds\n\nNow for the good parts.\nInstallation and configuration was super easy. In fact I did it myself in ~15 mins. My grandma looked like she could do it as well.\nThere is a general setting which lets you remember the last used input source. So you can use it an a dumb display with your set-top box or radio frequency TV cable. In my case I found it much more convenient to use my Jio set top box to stream online content in full HD (primevideo, youtube) than using Mi's android tv or patchwall\n\nVerdict\nThe image quality may be forgiven if you pair the TV with good home-theater audio, otherwise this TV is suitable for 1000 rs per night hotel rooms\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610K6tNNRHL._SY88.jpg,3,if you pay peanuts you will get monkey,"\ n you buy cheap and cheap is what you get . no complaints for what i got for the price i paid \ nswitching from a 7 year old sony 21 "" to a mi tv 43 "" , the change in both picture and audio quality is not just noticeable , it is in your face . \ ni mean the audio sounds cheap and tinny . even my jbl bluetooth sounds better . \ nthe image quality is just about suffer-able . also if you are used to 1080p displays like on your phone , laptop , tv with much smaller screens , fhd on 43 "" will give you a terrible experience especially with this tv that does zero anti-aliasing . i cant get past those pixel corners that are so clearly visible . if you do n't understand what i am saying , look at the curve of ' m ' in mi when the tv boots up . \ nbefore buying this tv i had read many review which mentioned losing wifi connectivity or apps crashing when streaming full hd content . i myself noticed the same in one of my office tvs and attributed it to poor wifi strength . but with this tv i can confirm that it is not the wifi , i have a nighthawk gigabit router sitting less than 5 feet from the tv . when i connect the tv to ethernet , i dont see any more youtube crashes . so the wifi card in the tv is trashy cheap too and unable to handle heavy traffic . \ nboot-up time of the os is not impressive either and takes ~ 60 seconds \ n \ nnow for the good parts . \ ninstallation and configuration was super easy . in fact i did it myself in ~ 15 mins . my grandma looked like she could do it as well . \ nthere is a general setting which lets you remember the last used input source . so you can use it an a dumb display with your set-top box or radio frequency tv cable . in my case i found it much more convenient to use my jio set top box to stream online content in full hd ( primevideo , youtube ) than using mi 's android tv or patchwall \ n \ nverdict \ nthe image quality may be forgiven if you pair the tv with good home-theater audio , otherwise this tv is suitable for 1000 rs per night hotel rooms \ n"

We share planet Earth with so many diverse animal &amp; plant species, but no other species has changed this planet to the extent we humans have. I always wondered why humans? Why us?\nI got my answers in ‘Sapiens’. A brilliantly written masterpiece by Dr Yuval Noah Harari on history of humankind. Dr Harari has very elaborately explained why Homo Sapiens are different. What has propelled this one species from being just another life form to becoming the most dominant biological entity on Earth? Dr Harari says what distinguishes Homo Sapiens from others is our ability to believe in imagined entities. This enables us to cooperate in large groups.\n“Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination”\nHomo Deus on the other hand talks about future of Homo Sapiens. The future that author has talked about can be a wonder ride, scary, shocking for you depending on how you look at it. If you have already read Sapiens you will feel the Homo Deus being repetitive. Author has devoted significant portion talking about why Homo Sapiens have been successful till now. Most of the key challenges Homo Sapiens faced till 20th century have already been resolved. But will we remain satisfied just because we resolved challenges we have been facing till now? Author says ‘No’\n“We do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon” -Homo Deus\nIf you want to know what we will be up to I strongly recommend Homo Deus to you.

Bass is superb too.\n\n2. Built quality : marvelous built. One thing I like about JBL is that they make slight changes even if the launched model is way old. Built quality has been upgraded. Only thing I wanted was L shaped lead but it's fine.\n\n3. Noise cancellation : great noise cancellation. You can totally rely on this. Once you put on everything will seem great about it.\n\n4. Ear comfort : fits too well. You won't need to adjust them once you've put them on.\n\nCons : apart from the normal shaped lead I didn't found any cons about it. It will last for more than an year and can even work for more than 2 years if handled carefully.\n\nHope this will help you decide.\nHave a nice day!!\n,0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YzqVhk3DL._SY88.jpg,3,do n't think . just buy ! ! !,\ n superb product ! ! this is my 2nd time buying these earphones . before these i purchased sennheiser cx 180 street 2 but in just 3 months the sound quality dropped to minimum . had to switch back to jbl . \ n \ nso here 's the detailed review . . . \ n \ npros :\ n \ n1 . sound : too great . had to put my sound bar to half . quality does n't lessens even at the max sound . bass is superb too . \ n \ n2 . built quality : marvelous built . one thing i like about jbl is that they make slight changes even if the launched model is way old . built quality has been upgraded . only thing i wanted was l shaped lead but it 's fine . \ n \ n3 . noise cancellation : great noise cancellation . you can totally rely on this . once you put on everything will seem great about it . \ n \ n4 . ear comfort : fits too well . you wo n't need to adjust them once you 've put them on . \ n \ ncons : apart from the normal shaped lead i did n't found any cons about it . it will last for more than an year and can even work for more than 2 years if handled carefully . \ n \ nhope this will help you decide . \ nhave a nice day ! ! \ n

Problems recurred after a week.\n\nMy diagnosis: Ageing disk, probably with few bad sectors that Apple formatting APFS was tripping over. Decided to change internal HDD to SSD, and add more RAM.\n\nSamsung 860EVO 500GB seemed the best, affordable choice. Would have preferred the ‘blade’ NVMe 970 Pro, but it is more than double the price; more importantly, it’s incompatible with the iMac’s pin and channel configuration.\n\nSo, I picked the Samsung 860 EVO and&nbsp;\n; \n &nbsp;for my upgrade.\n\nUpgrading the internal drive of a slim-profile (5mm) iMac is not easy. Even in experienced hands, there is a very high risk of damaging the LED display panel, which has to be sliced off the aluminium chassis (see iFixit’s tutorial). Even more dangerous is remounting the display panel, as the quality and strength of the tapes sold online are highly suspect, with many users reporting that their displays fell off and smashed after remounting with such tapes.\n\nThe OEM adhesive strip used by Apple is a custom 3M VHB tape (5mm wide, 1 mm thick). So I spoke with 3M India, and after keeping me dangling in hope for 3 weeks, they stopped taking my calls. Thanks 3M. :(\n\nThe workaround was to shop around with Apple Authorised Resellers / Service. None of them would sell me the mounting tape separately, but they would do my disk upgrade for a price ranging from ₹4800 to ₹2500 (tape + service). Seemed the better option, as it mitigated the risk of damaging the display panel and ruining my Mac.\n\nPreparation:\n• Installed the Crucial RAM myself (8GB x 2 slots).\n• Cloned my existing hard drive to the Samsung SSD 860 EVO, and ran it externally as the boot drive to check things out, for about a week.\n• Took my Mac and new, data-loaded and bootable SSD to an Apple Authorised Service Center, on the appointed date.\n\n2 hours later, my upgrade was done.\n\nI did not buy or use a 3.5 to 2.5” drive adapter; double-sided tape is sufficient to mount the SSD inside the iMac’s chassis (technicians concurred). Neither does the SSD require an external ‘thermal sensor’; it runs cool.\n\nPost upgrade:\n1. The first thing to do after the SSD is the internal boot drive is to startup normally, and do a full Time Machine backup.\n2. Once done, ENABLE TRIM (by default, Apple disables TRIM on 3rd party SSDs).\n3. Open Terminal, and type in (exactly, without the quote marks): “sudo trimforce enable”, then Y when asked ‘Do you want to proceed?’\n4. Reboot and press SHIFT (for SAFE BOOT)\n5. After boot, go to  &gt; About this Mac &gt; System Report &gt; SATA / SATA Express and see that TRIM is enabled\n6. Reboot normally, and you’re done!\n\n* Note 1: It is ALWAYS a good idea to keep at least 25% of your drive free for better system performance, so move those large files to an always-connected external device.\n* Note 2: Samsung Magician does not have a Mac version\n\nPost the upgrade from OEM Seagate 7200 rpm 1TB to Samsung 860 EVO SSD 500GB, drive speed is up almost 300%. All the spinning beachballs, unexpected shutdowns, and interminable startup times are gone. Things work at a snap (almost zero latency).\n\nSo far, I’m delighted!\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kPO9vv9RL._SY88.jpg,3,it 's like getting a new computer !,"\ n changing your computer 's internal spinning hard disk to a solid-state drive ( ssd ) is like getting a turbocharged upgrade ; add some ram , and you 've got yourself a new computer in performance terms . \ n \ nmy setup : imac 27 ” [ late 2013 ] , 1tb , 8gb ram \ nproblem : inexplicable beachballs , auto restarts , hangs , slow boots , very slow app launches . . . \ n • apple hardware test : all ok \ n • apple disk first aid : all ok / repeated corruption of snapshots \ n - approach : clean installed os , data restored from icloud and time machine . problems recurred after a week . \ n \ nmy diagnosis : ageing disk , probably with few bad sectors that apple formatting apfs was tripping over . decided to change internal hdd to ssd , and add more ram . \ n \ nsamsung 860evo 500gb seemed the best , affordable choice . would have preferred the ‘ blade ' nvme 970 pro , but it is more than double the price ; more importantly , it 's incompatible with the imac 's pin and channel configuration . \ n \ nso , i picked the samsung 860 evo and \ n ; \ n for my upgrade . \ n \ nupgrading the internal drive of a slim-profile ( 5mm ) imac is not easy . even in experienced hands , there is a very high risk of damaging the led display panel , which has to be sliced off the aluminium chassis ( see ifixit 's tutorial ) . even more dangerous is remounting the display panel , as the quality and strength of the tapes sold online are highly suspect , with many users reporting that their displays fell off and smashed after remounting with such tapes . \ n \ nthe oem adhesive strip used by apple is a custom 3m vhb tape ( 5mm wide , 1 mm thick ) . so i spoke with 3m india , and after keeping me dangling in hope for 3 weeks , they stopped taking my calls . thanks 3m . :( \ n \ nthe workaround was to shop around with apple authorised resellers / service . none of them would sell me the mounting tape separately , but they would do my disk upgrade for a price ranging from ₹ 4800 to ₹ 2500 ( tape + service ) . seemed the better option , as it mitigated the risk of damaging the display panel and ruining my mac . \ n \ npreparation :\ n • installed the crucial ram myself (8 gb x 2 slots ) . \ n • cloned my existing hard drive to the samsung ssd 860 evo , and ran it externally as the boot drive to check things out , for about a week . \ n • took my mac and new , data-loaded and bootable ssd to an apple authorised service center , on the appointed date . \ n \ n2 hours later , my upgrade was done . \ n \ ni did not buy or use a 3 . 5 to 2 . 5 ” drive adapter ; double-sided tape is sufficient to mount the ssd inside the imac 's chassis ( technicians concurred ) . neither does the ssd require an external ‘ thermal sensor ' ; it runs cool . \ n \ npost upgrade :\ n1 . the first thing to do after the ssd is the internal boot drive is to startup normally , and do a full time machine backup . \ n2 . once done , enable trim ( by default , apple disables trim on 3rd party ssds ) . \ n3 . open terminal , and type in ( exactly , without the quote marks ): “ sudo trimforce enable ” , then y when asked ‘ do you want to proceed ?

USB Type B is an older port and is replaced by mini usb 5 pin B which this mic would now come with. Mine was usb mini as mentioned and I was successfully able to register my product serial number with Logitech (Since Blue company is now acquired by Logitech). Even Blue Sherpa Companion app was able to find my mic with correct serial number. So relax it is original only.\nNow for the review part-\n1. Amazon packaging was pathetic the box was damaged, they sent me the box in a white amazon polythene instead of packing it inside a cardboard box. Not sure what happened here usually Amazon pack things nicely so I guess it was the seller (Bought it from prime seller). However luckily my mic was not damaged. (Touchwood)\n2. Talking about mic itself, it is simply amazing, It captures the lows, the mids and the highs perfectly without any problems.\n3. Noise cancellation is okay, not best for sure but very decent, live streaming should not be a problem at all and if you are using it for voice overs you can post process it in either audacity or premier pro to make it sound like a professional studio mic.\n4. The wire sent with the mic was black for some reason even though my mic was white but it still looks absolutely stunning sitting on your desk, clubs very well with the setup, definitely an eye catcher.\n5. Stand provided with it is sturdy and has nice rubber feet so it will not slip off easily and will hold it’s position.\n Overall a great mic even in 2020 for beginners and growing youtubers, definitely gives you a professional edge without putting a whole in your pocket. I bought it during covid so costed me around 5k but you should be able to find a good deal on this, though it’s still worth it at 5k considering the sound it’s amazing sound quality. Would have given 5 stars but had to cut 1 star for packaging.\n\nIf you’re looking for a condenser mic which is easy to setup and is bang for your buck, look no further and buy this. You will not regret.\n\nThanks for taking time out to read my review.

Some of those were gifted by well-meaning friends. Some of them were books I bought on an impulse. Then there were books that I had waited years to read only to find them unworthy of all those years of patience. But this book by Yuval Noah Harari tops the list. Just imagine reading a book that all your friends were going gaga about, only to find that there is nothing worthwhile in it and wondering whether you are really a good reader at all, now that you don’t even like a book that the whole world around you seems to love!\n\nLet’s clear a few things first, before you think of bashing me up. This is a commendable effort by Mr. Harari to summarize the whole history of mankind and its evolutionary tale. During the initial pages, I too thought that this will be one of the best reads on anthropology. But this book promises a lot only to deceive. We statisticians use the term confirmation bias, which means the tendency to favor and present only those information that are supportive to one’s beliefs. This book is full of them. Harari had decided to present all that is wicked and weak about Homo Sapiens and he has succeeded to a large extent.\n\nNot that I am complaining. I for one have never held the notion that we humans are special beings sitting atop the food chain, placed there by a favorable god who created us all in his (or, is it a ‘her’?) own image. I think of us as a different species of apes that managed to evolve a little quicker than our cousins. Despite our use of advanced languages, costly clothes and snazzy gadgets, internally we remain the beasts that roamed the vast forests once. I see nothing special about being human. This book helped cement that belief in my mind by discussing the idiocies and idiosyncrasies of our species as a whole.\n\nBut that’s just about it. This book isn’t ‘a brief history of humankind’, but the opinions of Mr. Harari about the various aspects of human evolution. This isn’t a chronological history in the lines of ‘What on Earth Happened?’ by Christopher Lloyd or ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’ by Bill Bryson, both of which I found to be far more informative and interesting than this one. This is both a philosophical take and passing of judgments by Mr. Harari on what he considers to be the vital cogs of human evolution, namely Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution &amp; Scientific Revolution. There is nothing that you end up learning that you already didn’t learn, especially in case you had read those two aforementioned books.\n\nSorry, dear friends.

So far so good !! Heavy Duty Battery. Top specs at a reasonable price.,"\n I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.\nThis phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.\n\nNow coming to the phone :\n\nPros :-\n1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.\n2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.\n3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.\n4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.\n5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.\n6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.\nOther conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nNow coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :\n1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.\n2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.\n3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.\n\nOverall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718ik5N9YzL._SY88.jpg,3,awesome buy ! ! so far so good ! ! heavy duty battery . top specs at a reasonable price .,"\ n i used to be a samsung customer long back but had switched to chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now . it is very refreshing to see samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20 k segment . \ nthis phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of samsung in this price bracket . \ n \ nnow coming to the phone :\ n \ npros :-\ n1 . battery : this has to be the single largest plus point of this phone . at 6000mah , its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge . on the other hand , this battery easily lasts 1 . 5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage . \ n2 . dedicated memory slot ( 2 + 1 ) : this is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card . \ n3 . screen quality - it is fhd + screen with nice and smooth colors . there is no lag and it feels fluidic . where it scores over other brands is that samsung offers super amoled screen whereas other brands have lcd capacitive touch screen . though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one . \ n4 . camera - again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm . also , there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution . front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp . no lag in clicking front photos as well . \ n5 . size : it is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand . \ n6 . memory : 6gb ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient . plus , the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on . \ nother conviniences include - type c charging port and fast charging support and 3 . 5 mm audio jack . \ n \ nnow coming to the cons . not many but a couple i definitely noticed :\ n1 . fingerprint sensor : it is not just bad but very bad ( and i mean it ) . very unresponsive and erratic . i mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger . and it may sometimes glitch as well . so , you need to retry . \ n2 . charging cable : extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless . length is very insufficient . \ n3 . charger : it is a standard 5v - 2a charger . they could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging . \ n \ noverall if you take a look at the price ( 15k ) , it is an awesome buy . apart from the fingerprint sensor , i found everything in the phone to be top-notch . the specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer . would definitely recommend this anytime :) \ n"

It ACTUALLY does. Can confirm. It feels like a totally different laptop. I couldn't believe it when I first started installing windows and updates, couldn't believe the speed of just getting things done, and the responsiveness of my laptop. It's like using a 90 Hz panel for the first time.\n\nJust installed the Crucial MX500 @ 500 gigs. Startup times and restart times are blazing fast. Takes only 30-40 seconds for a full restart.

Also, most laptop/desktop motherboards easily support varying lengths of m.2 SSDs like 2242 2260 and the longest 2280 (22 is the width in mm where as the last 2 numbers i.e. 42, 60 and 80 are the lengths in mm).\n\nAlso, a 2.5 inch (7 mm or 9 mm) HDD/SSD enclosure can also be bought so that you can keep your old HDD/SSD as a portable HDD/SSD within the enclosure. I bought the transparent ORICO 2.5 mm model 2193U3 HDD/SSD enclosure (have reviewed that as well) and i keep my 7200 rpm 1TB HDD inside this enclosure after having it replaced with the 2TB Samsung 870 EVO.\n\nLikewise, there is also an enclosure for the m.2 NVME PCIE SSD available from the same brand, ORICO. Check it out at amazon.in as well.\n\nSo, I made a BOOTABLE win10 usb (using the Windows Medial tool online) so that I can install the OS on the newly installed m.2 2280 ssd and the entire process took less than 30 mins from hardware installation to OS inatallation from USB to the new m.2 ssd.\n\nThere is Less to No Comparison of Quality and Price of Samsung SSDs with other brands like Sabrent, Crucial, WD etc.\n\nKindly like the review if it helped to make your buying decision that much easier.\n\nCheers and e-peace...\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A18LEeAZrFL._SY88.jpg,3,best bang for you buck .,"\ n hello amazonians , \ n \ nmy existing setup is as follows :\ nlaptop : legion y740 15inch with rtx 2070 maxq \ nhdd : 1tb 2 . 5 inch ( 7mm ) 7200rpm ( stock ) \ nssd : 128gb m . 2 nvme pcie 2242 m + b key ( stock ) with win 10home \ n \ nwanted to upgrade both the :\ na . ) existing 1tb 7200 rpm hdd as well as the \ nb . ) 128gb m . 2 nvme pcie ssd \ n \ nwith :\ n \ na . ) 2tb samsung 870 evo 2 . 5 inch sata ssd \ nb . ) 1tb samsung 980 m . 2 ( 2280 ) nvme pcie ssd m key ( for win 10 os ) . \ n \ nas i only use the lenovo legion y740 15 "" for gaming purpose so with games having humongous download sizes , 1tb hdd was filling up faster ( was left with only 250gb of 1tb space ) and also the 7200rpm drive was real slow for game load times ( waiting of 3-5 mins ) for a game load . \ n \ nas of the current gen , a nvme pcie based m . 2 ssd is the fastest drive in the market and samsung 980 is the latest iteration from its new lineup of m . 2 . \ n \ nofcourse there are the pro version m . 2 ' s as well but those are just out of budget and out of scope from a gaming / home use kind of scenarios unless one is into heavy video editing , designing and vfx purposes . \ n \ ninstalling both the ssds is fairly simple as just the screws are to be removed ( follow your laptop manual for the same ) and pop in these in their respective slots and secure them with screws . \ n \ na word of caution though : m . 2 slot on the laptop / desktop motherboard are mostly "" m key "" based ( female notch placed at the right side of a m . 2 ssd that goes into the male notch on the motherboard ) . also , most laptop / desktop motherboards easily support varying lengths of m . 2 ssds like 2242 2260 and the longest 2280 ( 22 is the width in mm where as the last 2 numbers i . e . 42 , 60 and 80 are the lengths in mm ) . \ n \ nalso , a 2 . 5 inch ( 7 mm or 9 mm ) hdd / ssd enclosure can also be bought so that you can keep your old hdd / ssd as a portable hdd / ssd within the enclosure . i bought the transparent orico 2 . 5 mm model 2193u3 hdd / ssd enclosure ( have reviewed that as well ) and i keep my 7200 rpm 1tb hdd inside this enclosure after having it replaced with the 2tb samsung 870 evo . \ n \ nlikewise , there is also an enclosure for the m . 2 nvme pcie ssd available from the same brand , orico . check it out at amazon . in as well . \ n \ nso , i made a bootable win 10 usb ( using the windows medial tool online ) so that i can install the os on the newly installed m . 2 2280 ssd and the entire process took less than 30 mins from hardware installation to os inatallation from usb to the new m . 2 ssd . \ n \ nthere is less to no comparison of quality and price of samsung ssds with other brands like sabrent , crucial , wd etc . \ n \ nkindly like the review if it helped to make your buying decision that much easier . \ n \ ncheers and e-peace . . . \ n"

Sometime have to slide 2-3 times to work.\n3) Outer button is very heavy\n4) ONLY 5 watch faces and all are very simple, not even one is as good as the competitors. Other companies providing 100's of watch faces. When contacted Gonoise, there answer is always that there will soon be an update. But they are busy releasing faces for NAV now and nothing on colorfit pro2.\n5) Notifications not working with my OnePlus\n6) Battery life comes out to be 4-5 days max, with bluetooth connectivity to 1 or 2 times a day to sync. Company claims 10 days, so this is 50% less.\n7) Heart rate looks ambiguous. It gives a fluctuating reading between 40 to 100. I had Lenovo band which had pretty much stable heart rate.\n8) Already facing hardware issues, with LCD getting white tint in corner and some discoloration in the center.\n\nOverall i can say, I was happy to buy based on ratings and their publicity about the features, BUT soon realized its just a good looking,, good for nothing watch.\nLook for other options before thinking of buying this, there are Cross, Huwaei and even if you have to increase budget go for it.\n",1,sadness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YlF51c6qL._SY88.jpg,4,good looking outside but inside not even worth 1000,"\ n have been using this for 2 months now . already got lcd issues . raised a complaint . \ n \ npros :\ n1 ) good looking , kind of looks like apple . . but kind of only \ n2 ) light weight and makes the first look at it really nice , , but as saying is "" looks can be deceiving "" \ n2 ) little less price than competition . \ n \ ncons :\ n1 ) looks good but watch size is weird as compared to lcd size , looks out of place when turned on . \ n2 ) touch is not free flow . sometime have to slide 2-3 times to work . \ n3 ) outer button is very heavy \ n4 ) only 5 watch faces and all are very simple , not even one is as good as the competitors . other companies providing 100 ' s of watch faces . when contacted gonoise , there answer is always that there will soon be an update . but they are busy releasing faces for nav now and nothing on colorfit pro 2 . \ n5 ) notifications not working with my oneplus \ n6 ) battery life comes out to be 4-5 days max , with bluetooth connectivity to 1 or 2 times a day to sync . company claims 10 days , so this is 50 % less . \ n7 ) heart rate looks ambiguous . it gives a fluctuating reading between 40 to 100 . i had lenovo band which had pretty much stable heart rate . \ n8 ) already facing hardware issues , with lcd getting white tint in corner and some discoloration in the center . \ n \ noverall i can say , i was happy to buy based on ratings and their publicity about the features , but soon realized its just a good looking , , good for nothing watch . \ nlook for other options before thinking of buying this , there are cross , huwaei and even if you have to increase budget go for it . \ n"

After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.\n\n*Camera:\n\nRear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.\nFront camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.\n\n* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.\n\n* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:\n--&gt; Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)\n--&gt; 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming\n--&gt; 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)\nDisclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.\n\n* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.\n\n* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.\n\n* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.\n\n* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).\n\n* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...\n--&gt; Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)\n--&gt; Personally love the Dark Mode.\n\nOverall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714y-Z3T93L._SY88.jpg,3,superb budget phone by samsung,"\ n purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i . e . 5th march 2020 ; 12:00 pm . after using more than a week , reviewing the phone on 14th march 2020 ; 5:15 pm . i hope you will find it helpful . \ n \ n * camera :\ n \ nrear camera has few mode / frames . out of which it 's fixed 3:4 ( 64 mp ) has great picture quality . other modes / frame like 3:4 , 9:16 , 1:1 , full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it . video quality is also good but could be better . \ nfront camera 32 mp is also fine . you will get delicately balanced picture quality . \ n \ n * 6 . 4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets . \ n \ n * battery ( 6000mah ): it stood on its ground . surely have high battery backup . did few experiments and here 's the result :\ n --> around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages ( wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running ) \ n --> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming \ n --> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi ( not sure for mobile network ) \ ndisclaimer : these hours may vary as per individual use and environment . i 'm sharing the details as per my own usage . \ n \ n * exynos 9611 octa core processor : samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor . the processor speed with the combination of android v10 is great . i did n't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games . the ram was n't even getting used completely . however , if we compare this processor with snapdragon , i can say that this processor is equivalent to snapdragon 700 series . \ n \ n * face unlock and fingerprint sensor : company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor . however , i did n't find that true . for face unlock , the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face . \ n \ n * phone comes with dual sim ( nano + nano ) facility but with dual standby . both sims are n't active simultaneously . \ n \ n * both charging slot and 3 . 5 mm jack for earphones are placed at same end ( bottom side ) , which i personally did n't like ( that is one of the reason i rate it 4 star ) . \ n \ n * there are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not . example : wifi calling support , blue light filter , smart view , ultra data saving mode , dulby atmos , dark mode etc . . . \ n --> dulby atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones ( i personally did n't find it that good . sound quality seems similar ) \ n --> personally love the dark mode . \ n \ noverall , the smartphone is great . if you want to purchase a smartphone within this range , you may go ahead with this one . \ n"

What that essentially means is that there's nothing better than the M50x under ₹20k. The better beyerdynamic ones are more expensive than 20k. Just friggin get it. I don't think with the increased price of the M40x (at the time of writing the review it's selling for about 9k) the M40x is a good value anymore. Also, get the brainwavz sheepskin pads. Stock pads are trash. Skip to the end for the scores.\nSidenote, amazon really ruined the packaging in the delivery process. On top of that, it was just lying there in the so-called “final destination” hub that’s like 5km from my home for 4 days. The amazon packaging as well as the M50x box got absolutely wet and wrecked. Really disappointed, Amazon (it was Amazon Transportation Services, mind you). This however is also a testament to the built quality of the headphones as they were in perfect condition despite the heavy beating the packaging received, and hence won’t be returning them. I just don’t have the time to wait another month for amazon to replace the thing. I need to get my work done.\n\nSOUND\n\nAlright down to business now. If accurate is the word you're looking for, you've come to the right place. The M50x has excellent reproduction and it's immensely revealing. More so than the M40x. The sound stage is wide for a closed back headphone. The major improvement over the M40x would be the excellent imaging which was quite mediocre in the M40x. Instrument separation is excellent as well. Even the most intricate producing trickeries that most headphones in this price point can’t even reproduce become crystal clear. If you’re upgrading from something cheaper or the dreaded skullcandy or beats headphones, you’ll be surprised how much you were missing out on. If frequency response graphs are anything to go by, M50x is supposed to be more flat compared to the M40x but to my ears, the M50x seem to have a very slight emphasis on the lows. I was surprised to see that Audio-Technica has done away with the foam sheets that they used to put in between the driver and the earpad and actually tweaked the driver design, which is a good thing. You don’t have to worry about the thin foam sheets while changing pads. Not having to rely on those is always a good thing. I didn’t notice any drastic change in the sound quality with the change in pads. Perhaps slightly better sound stage.\n\nBUILD AND COMFORT\n\n With the stock pads, the comfort isn’t anything to write home about. But it’s not bad. The pads are still pleather so they’ll last 2 years at most, though it does depend on how rough you use them. I already had the sheepskin pads from my M40x, which recently broke. Not the headphone’s fault. A certain person had borrowed them from me for a few days and he managed to break the thing somehow, at an age of 4 years. Rest in Peace, my dear M40x. Ah, right. The M50x. Excellent build quality, mediocre comfort with the stock pads. With almost any pad, it’ll get hot and sweaty during summers unless you’ve got everything air conditioned. The clamping force is a bit high but not uncomfortably so. It WILL loosen up a bit with time and become really comfortable. The folds and turns feel solid and the fold-in mechanism is satisfyingly clicky. The bottomline is I wouldn’t worry about it breaking on me unless I was a very rough user. If you’re one of those, you need some industrial construction equipment, not the M50x… or loads of cash to buy spare headphones. The top layer of the pleather does tend to wear off though, but it’s universally the case for all pleather. Not a big issue. Once it starts happening, just take half an hour to peel all of it off. The bare grey Velor kinda material looks way sleeker in my opinion.\n\nSCORES\n Sound: 9/10\n Comfort: 7/10, 9.5/10 with the pads replaced\n Build: 9/10\n Soundstage: 7/10\n Imaging: 9/10\n Separation: 10/10\n Sound isolation, passive: 7/10, 8/10 with the pads replaced.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Hm-xeXAtL._SY88.jpg,3,industry standard for a reason !,"\ n tldr \ n \ nbetter than the m40x for critical work in the sense that it is more revealing and arguably more accurate . what that essentially means is that there 's nothing better than the m50x under ₹ 20k . the better beyerdynamic ones are more expensive than 20k . just friggin get it . i do n't think with the increased price of the m40x ( at the time of writing the review it 's selling for about 9k ) the m40x is a good value anymore . also , get the brainwavz sheepskin pads . stock pads are trash . skip to the end for the scores . \ nsidenote , amazon really ruined the packaging in the delivery process . on top of that , it was just lying there in the so-called “ final destination ” hub that 's like 5km from my home for 4 days . the amazon packaging as well as the m50x box got absolutely wet and wrecked . really disappointed , amazon ( it was amazon transportation services , mind you ) . this however is also a testament to the built quality of the headphones as they were in perfect condition despite the heavy beating the packaging received , and hence wo n't be returning them . i just do n't have the time to wait another month for amazon to replace the thing . i need to get my work done . \ n \ nsound \ n \ nalright down to business now . if accurate is the word you 're looking for , you 've come to the right place . the m50x has excellent reproduction and it 's immensely revealing . more so than the m40x . the sound stage is wide for a closed back headphone . the major improvement over the m40x would be the excellent imaging which was quite mediocre in the m40x . instrument separation is excellent as well . even the most intricate producing trickeries that most headphones in this price point can't even reproduce become crystal clear . if you 're upgrading from something cheaper or the dreaded skullcandy or beats headphones , you 'll be surprised how much you were missing out on . if frequency response graphs are anything to go by , m50x is supposed to be more flat compared to the m40x but to my ears , the m50x seem to have a very slight emphasis on the lows . i was surprised to see that audio-technica has done away with the foam sheets that they used to put in between the driver and the earpad and actually tweaked the driver design , which is a good thing . you do n't have to worry about the thin foam sheets while changing pads . not having to rely on those is always a good thing . i did n't notice any drastic change in the sound quality with the change in pads . perhaps slightly better sound stage . \ n \ nbuild and comfort \ n \ n with the stock pads , the comfort is n't anything to write home about . but it 's not bad . the pads are still pleather so they 'll last 2 years at most , though it does depend on how rough you use them . i already had the sheepskin pads from my m40x , which recently broke . not the headphone 's fault . a certain person had borrowed them from me for a few days and he managed to break the thing somehow , at an age of 4 years . rest in peace , my dear m40x . ah , right . the m50x . excellent build quality , mediocre comfort with the stock pads . with almost any pad , it 'll get hot and sweaty during summers unless you 've got everything air conditioned . the clamping force is a bit high but not uncomfortably so . it will loosen up a bit with time and become really comfortable . the folds and turns feel solid and the fold-in mechanism is satisfyingly clicky . the bottomline is i would n't worry about it breaking on me unless i was a very rough user . if you 're one of those , you need some industrial construction equipment , not the m50x . . . or loads of cash to buy spare headphones . the top layer of the pleather does tend to wear off though , but it 's universally the case for all pleather . not a big issue . once it starts happening , just take half an hour to peel all of it off . the bare grey velor kinda material looks way sleeker in my opinion . \ n \ nscores \ n sound : 9/10 \ n comfort : 7/10 , 9 . 5 / 10 with the pads replaced \ n build : 9/10 \ n soundstage : 7/10 \ n imaging : 9/10 \ n separation : 10/10 \ n sound isolation , passive : 7/10 , 8/ 10 with the pads replaced . \ n"

Hats off to Amazon! Packaging was great as usual from Amazon/Cloudtail.\n\nI have posted a comprehensive unboxing/review video on my YouTube channel. Please check that out for the mic test at this link -\n[...]\n\nI wanted an entry level/budget microphone for my YouTube videos. After going through reviews of the Blue Snowball, Samson Meteorite and Blue Snowball ICE, I decided to get this one. In the package you'll get the microphone, USB cable, tripod stand and a manual. The build quality is excellent and feels very premium. The microphone itself looks very cute and stylish. It feels very solid and sturdy in the hand.\n\nSetup is very simple. You just need to screw the tripod stand into the microphone and set it on the table. Plug the microphone into the laptop via the USB cable and the light on top of the microphone glows red. That's it! Its good to go! Its plug and play, so no drivers or software or application required. Go to Sound settings of your laptop and select the Snowball ICE as the recording device. You can then use any audio recording software (like Audacity) to record the audio. It takes power from the laptop and no separate power source required.\n\nThe Snowball ICE only has a cardioid/uni-directional mode for recording. So it'll pick up sound from any source directly in-front of it. The optimal distance between the sound source and the microphone should be around 8-12 inches. Moving farther away from the mic will reduce the intensity and up close you would hear your voice popping at the 'B's and 'P's.\n\nIf you're looking for a budget USB microphone for podcasts/YouTube videos/Skype calls, then look no further. I got it for Rs. 4399 as part of the festive season sale.

And if the music is on, you won't be able to listen majority of things going on outside. Even in great traffic, it cuts the noise to half of the original intensity without any music. With music,it cuts off the noise upto 97%.\n2.Sound is perfectly balanced.It was a great experience to listen to all the genres with it.I had absolutely no problem with it. It's been a year now since I am using them and they are still perfect man!👌👌👌\n3. Mike is located at the perfect spot and has a good power if catching sound. The mike button also works pretty well.\n4. Have recommended it to all my friends and they loved it too.\nCon:-\nThis may be only in my case. Because my ears are the smallest ears to be found(according to my family and friends)😄😄😄 and only the smallest size of ear buds fit in my ears. And I didn't get the smallest size of earbuds with this earphone.So, had to arrange it from outside.\nThat's not a big issue as it seems. But lemme tell you, if the earbuds are not fitting perfectly inside, then, audio experience and the noise cancellation property, all goes in vain because your earphones would be falling out of your ear every now and then which is very irritating.\n2. And being from a middle class household, Honestly it was a bit costly for me🙄...but i saved money and purchased it.No regrets for that. It's awesome.But to prevent any damage to it,I covered it up with cover(spiral wires).\nOtherwise, no problem at all.

The price just before the sale was Rs 2,696/- but on sale, it had a lightning deal of 2,499/- and I got 10% Rs 250 additional discount for HDFC Card. In Short, I got the SSD for Rs 2249/-.\nThis SSD is worth every penny. I have a Lenovo Ideapad 320-15IKB (Type 81BG, 81BT) with basic configuration ( i5 8th gen, 8GB ram and 1TB 5400 rpm HDD). After 2 years of use, the laptop became super slow, boot time was around two minutes and it used to get stuck very often (couldn't open more than 4-5 tabs in chrome at one go). Tried every tweak youtube videos had to offer but there was no visible performance improvement. Somebody suggested to buy an SSD ( I didn't wanted to spend much on it honestly ). After searching and reading comments I finally decided to go for this one. Below is my view of this product to help you decide to make an informed choice if you wish to get one:\n1. Boot time on my machine is less than 12 seconds\n2. MS office opens as soon as you click on a file (haven't seen taking more than 3 seconds)\n3. Chrome is never stuck (can open 10-12 tabs, never tried more than that but pretty sure it can handle more)\n4. Significant time reduction in transferring a file from Pendrive, hard drive, phone\n5. 2.2k for a 240gb SSD is the best deal, can't say about the coming times as technology improves but this is the best deal you can get for now\n6. Some people have written non-satisfactory reviews on this (and they have compared it with Samsung Evo, let me tell you, I am sure that is among the best SSD available, but it comes at double the price with maybe 20% extra performance, you can do the math to figure out which is a better option when it comes to value buy)\n7. Honest opinion: If you are someone looking for an SSD that offers decent performance (8-10x better than 5400rpm HDD), and don't wanna spend too much on it then this is a product for you.\n8. And lastly, enable ""Momentum Cache"" by downloading Crucial Storage Executive which will enhance your speed upto 6GBps. (Picture 1 is without enabling Momentum Cache facility and Picture 2 is using Momentum Cache facility.)\n\nI hope this review helps you in making an informed decision on buying an SSD.\nThank you.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713mmub4hFL._SY88.jpg,3,worth purchasing,"\ n i bought my crucial 240gb ssd on 16th october 2020 during the great indian festival sale . the price just before the sale was rs 2,696 / - but on sale , it had a lightning deal of 2,499 / - and i got 10 % rs 250 additional discount for hdfc card . in short , i got the ssd for rs 2249 / - . \ nthis ssd is worth every penny . i have a lenovo ideapad 320-15 ikb ( type 81bg , 81bt ) with basic configuration ( i5 8th gen , 8gb ram and 1tb 5400 rpm hdd ) . after 2 years of use , the laptop became super slow , boot time was around two minutes and it used to get stuck very often ( could n't open more than 4-5 tabs in chrome at one go ) . tried every tweak youtube videos had to offer but there was no visible performance improvement . somebody suggested to buy an ssd ( i did n't wanted to spend much on it honestly ) . after searching and reading comments i finally decided to go for this one . below is my view of this product to help you decide to make an informed choice if you wish to get one :\ n1 . boot time on my machine is less than 12 seconds \ n2 . ms office opens as soon as you click on a file ( have n't seen taking more than 3 seconds ) \ n3 . chrome is never stuck ( can open 10-12 tabs , never tried more than that but pretty sure it can handle more ) \ n4 . significant time reduction in transferring a file from pendrive , hard drive , phone \ n5 . 2 . 2 k for a 240gb ssd is the best deal , can't say about the coming times as technology improves but this is the best deal you can get for now \ n6 . some people have written non-satisfactory reviews on this ( and they have compared it with samsung evo , let me tell you , i am sure that is among the best ssd available , but it comes at double the price with maybe 20 % extra performance , you can do the math to figure out which is a better option when it comes to value buy ) \ n7 . honest opinion : if you are someone looking for an ssd that offers decent performance (8 - 10x better than 5400rpm hdd ) , and do n't wanna spend too much on it then this is a product for you . \ n8 . and lastly , enable "" momentum cache "" by downloading crucial storage executive which will enhance your speed upto 6gbps .

I'm sure that image will compress when uploading but believe me it's good.\n\nAudio call and network quality is good. No Bluetooth or wifi issues. Dolby Atmos is good to change the equalizer to your taste.\n\nDisplay has awesome contrast and colors and you can change settings for it.\nPlease do buy a case, the back plastic is a fingerprint magnet.

According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I’ve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features.\n One of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‘picture in Picture’ in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking.\n Apple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing.\n Iphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone.\n Along with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing “continuity feature” that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier.\n Being a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but, my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available.\n",0,sadness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VwBeNuPuL._SY88.jpg,4,iphone 11

The product colour matches with what is mentioned in the website.\nGenerally, I don't order clothes online because of fitting issues, but after seeing so many positive reviews for this product and that too at a meagre price, I placed an order to test my luck in ordering online. From all the clothes that I ordered online, this is the perfect fit I ever received. After receiving the first time, Ordered one more in another colour.\n\nEdit:1\nAs I mentioned earlier, received another one too, Quality is good and fit is awesome too.

The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.\n\nAnother area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review\n\nThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThat said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.\n\nIn low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThe smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.\n\nComing to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.\n\nOn the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MJ5tDk4OL._SY88.jpg,3,worth for every penny,"\ n let 's start with the first strong point of the samsung galaxy m31 , the design . the phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000 mah battery . the phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand , though the one-handed operation is not that great . the sides are slightly curved , which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach . the phone is available in two colour options , ocean blue and space black . we got the latter for review and it sure looks premium , though it picks up fingerprints and smudges , so putting in a case is the best option . \ n \ nanother area where the galaxy m31 does a good job is the display . the smartphone is loaded with a 6 . 4- inch full hd + infinity u display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels . the display is protected with corning gorilla glass 3 protection . the display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing . furthermore , the phone supports widevine l1 support , meaning that you can stream hd content on netflix and amazon prime videos . \ n \ nsamsung galaxy m31 : camera review \ n \ nthe galaxy m31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras . the phone is loaded with a 64 -

I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ics+vuFiL._SY88.jpg,3,the best decision of my life,"\ n from the last 3 months , i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect . i got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products . watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing , reviews . especially i was looking for cons rather than pros . i got to know that the display not being oled is not that good . then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model , except that everything is same . i came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts . from the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life . ios is buttery smooth , its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling . no lag whatsoever . ram management is superb . sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers . though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3 ( being a reviewer on youtube ) i get review units . next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone . it can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming . the display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels ( afterall its apple , you get what you pay ) . finally the camera makes you feel like so great . the photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc , you will see the clarity of the camera . video quality is superb . so overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs . hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not . \ n"

It talked about creating more options, by devoting time in your passion, taking small risks for increasing your experience and to get rid of the things which makes us more fragile.\n\nBefore reading this book I felt that there would be some manoeuvre to follow for finding your ikigai, but there is just overview of many therapies which left me little unsatisfied and disappointed. There were few things like proverbs, quotes and traditions from centritains which I found were not really required. There is no rocket science written in this book but some of the facts are eye opening.\n\nP. S . And seriously I wish I could learn sun salutation and other exercise by reading.\n\nOverall I will say it’s a easy, simple read for beginners for setting up small goals.\n\nOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.\n——-Japanese proverb\n\nBook starts with this proverb and this literally summarises the book.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tzySoukOL._SY88.jpg,3,little hyped ! !,"\ n ikigai \ nthe japanese secret to a long and happy life \ nby hector garcia and francesc miralles \ n \ ni will be confessing by saying that i bought this book just because of its attractive cover , such a soothing color combination which itself calmed me . \ n \ nthis book is all about finding your passion in life , your “ ikigai ” which will help you to live a happy , content , active and long life . it talks about art of staying young while growing old , about relaxing , about not running behind materialistic things , how to improve your performance in daily routine and to stay focused . \ n \ none of the best lesson which i liked was how to be more anti fragile . it talked about creating more options , by devoting time in your passion , taking small risks for increasing your experience and to get rid of the things which makes us more fragile . \ n \ nbefore reading this book i felt that there would be some manoeuvre to follow for finding your ikigai , but there is just overview of many therapies which left me little unsatisfied and disappointed . there were few things like proverbs , quotes and traditions from centritains which i found were not really required . there is no rocket science written in this book but some of the facts are eye opening . \ n \ np . s . and seriously i wish i could learn sun salutation and other exercise by reading . \ n \ noverall i will say it 's a easy , simple read for beginners for setting up small goals . \ n \ nonly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years . \ n — — - japanese proverb \ n \ nbook starts with this proverb and this literally summarises the book . \ n"
