I'll share with you how my journey buying this SSD was and what I learnt and what you should know.\n\nMX500 is not the most budget-friendly and entry-level SSD out there (there is WD Green, Crucial BX500, Kingston A400 and some others) but I would say it's excellent for the price. Before the MX500, I had purchased its younger sibling, BX500, and I noticed+learnt a couple of things with that.\n1. Similar transfer speeds at around 390 MB/s\n2. SLC caching (16 GB for 240 GB variant, 32 GB for 480 GB variant and so on). What it means is that after writing 16 GB, 32 GB and so on, write speed would drop significantly because instead of writing to the SLC cache of the drive, data would be written directly to the TLC. SLC is way faster than TLC (around 400 MB/s write to the drive while using SLC cache and around 50-80 MB/s once SLC cache is full).\nThis SLC cache varies from SSD to SSD and can be seen even on premium SSDs that cost 20k-30k (it brings down the cost, otherwise those drives would cost over a lakh or something!)\nAlso, the BX500 had a 3-year warranty (MX500 has a 5-year warranty) and lower TBW (Terabytes Written) rating than the MX500. So I returned my BX500 because the performance was an issue and chose to go with MX500.\n\nPerformance of the MX500 is superb. I have it hooked to my MacBook Air using a Transcend StoreJet SATA to USB adaptor thingy just like I did with the BX500. I transferred around 80 GB data from my MacBook to the MX500, and it moved files and folders at about 350 MB/s to the drive throughout the transfer, with speed drop to around 150 MB/s 5-6 times for 3-4 seconds each time (that was because it was moving tiny files and folders). Crucial says that the MX500 has a Dynamic Write Acceleration on their website. Well, it clearly works!\n\nSo should you buy an MX500? It depends. If you are planning to buy an SSD that will probably last for years, if you plan to write lots of data to the drive, if you need an SSD as a scratch disk (for photo and video editing) or if you want an SSD that's good but costs less than the Samsung SSDs, then go for MX500. I'm building a PC in a couple of weeks and I'll use the MX500 as the boot device in that.\nHowever, if you have an old laptop that is extremely slow and takes forever to start, maybe you have desktop with some old, failing hard drive and you are looking for an SSD, and you are not a heavy user (that is you'll browse the web, write emails and do stuff like that), then save some money (if you wish) and go for the BX500.\n\nAbout the delivery of the product, I got an empty box when I ordered the MX500 from Amazon. Once I got it and saw that the item was missing, I brought it to Amazon's notice, and they said they would take two days to conduct an investigation. However, when I called the next day, I got to know that they concluded that I could get a replacement or a refund. The process for replacement wasn't very smooth (it took about a week to get a replacement unit), but in the end, I got the product, and the product is pretty much excellent like I had expected, hence the five stars.\n\nAnother important thing that I want to mention is that the MRP in the box of the 500 GB variant of the MX500 is Rs 8,400 (screenshot attached) and at the time of writing this review on 30 June 2020, there are a couple of sellers on Amazon named ""Cart2India Online"" and ""Cart2India SLP"" who are selling the product at twice the price (Rs 14,358). There are some other sellers also who list the MRP as Rs 9,000 or 10,000 and then say they are providing a discount of Rs 4,000 or Rs 5,000 when in fact, they are only offering a discount of Rs 2,500 or something. I especially saw this with the seller ""Gadget Buggy"". Basically, AVOID THESE SELLERS and buy from Appario Retail Private Ltd or the other Fulfilled By Amazon sellers.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mS+VsIiML._SY88.jpg,3,the perfect ssd for many even in 2020 ( also check the mrp listed by seller ),"\ n so i did n't know much about ssds before i set out to buy one . i 'll share with you how my journey buying this ssd was and what i learnt and what you should know . \ n \ nmx 500 is not the most budget-friendly and entry-level ssd out there ( there is wd green , crucial bx500 , kingston a400 and some others ) but i would say it 's excellent for the price . before the mx500 , i had purchased its younger sibling , bx500 , and i noticed + learnt a couple of things with that . \ n1 . similar transfer speeds at around 390 mb / s \ n2 . slc caching ( 16 gb for 240 gb variant , 32 gb for 480 gb variant and so on ) . what it means is that after writing 16 gb , 32 gb and so on , write speed would drop significantly because instead of writing to the slc cache of the drive , data would be written directly to the tlc . slc is way faster than tlc ( around 400 mb / s write to the drive while using slc cache and around 50-80 mb / s once slc cache is full ) . \ nthis slc cache varies from ssd to ssd and can be seen even on premium ssds that cost 20k - 30k ( it brings down the cost , otherwise those drives would cost over a lakh or something ! ) \ nalso , the bx500 had a 3 - year warranty ( mx500 has a 5 - year warranty ) and lower tbw ( terabytes written ) rating than the mx500 . so i returned my bx500 because the performance was an issue and chose to go with mx500 . \ n \ nperformance of the mx500 is superb . i have it hooked to my macbook air using a transcend storejet sata to usb adaptor thingy just like i did with the bx500 . i transferred around 80 gb data from my macbook to the mx500 , and it moved files and folders at about 350 mb / s to the drive throughout the transfer , with speed drop to around 150 mb / s 5-6 times for 3-4 seconds each time ( that was because it was moving tiny files and folders ) . crucial says that the mx500 has a dynamic write acceleration on their website . well , it clearly works ! \ n \ nso should you buy an mx500 ? it depends . if you are planning to buy an ssd that will probably last for years , if you plan to write lots of data to the drive , if you need an ssd as a scratch disk ( for photo and video editing ) or if you want an ssd that 's good but costs less than the samsung ssds , then go for mx500 . i 'm building a pc in a couple of weeks and i 'll use the mx500 as the boot device in that . \ nhowever , if you have an old laptop that is extremely slow and takes forever to start , maybe you have desktop with some old , failing hard drive and you are looking for an ssd , and you are not a heavy user ( that is you 'll browse the web , write emails and do stuff like that ) , then save some money ( if you wish ) and go for the bx500 . \ n \ nabout the delivery of the product , i got an empty box when i ordered the mx500 from amazon . once i got it and saw that the item was missing , i brought it to amazon 's notice , and they said they would take two days to conduct an investigation . however , when i called the next day , i got to know that they concluded that i could get a replacement or a refund . the process for replacement was n't very smooth ( it took about a week to get a replacement unit ) , but in the end , i got the product , and the product is pretty much excellent like i had expected , hence the five stars . \ n \ nanother important thing that i want to mention is that the mrp in the box of the 500 gb variant of the mx500 is rs 8,400 ( screenshot attached ) and at the time of writing this review on 30 june 2020 , there are a couple of sellers on amazon named "" cart 2india online "" and "" cart 2india slp "" who are selling the product at twice the price ( rs 14,358 ) . there are some other sellers also who list the mrp as rs 9,000 or 10,000 and then say they are providing a discount of rs 4,000 or rs 5,000 when in fact , they are only offering a discount of rs 2,500 or something . i especially saw this with the seller "" gadget buggy "" . basically , avoid these sellers and buy from appario retail private ltd or the other fulfilled by amazon sellers . \ n",3947.jpg

It talks about art of staying young while growing old, about relaxing, about not running behind materialistic things, how to improve your performance in daily routine and to stay focused.\n\nOne of the best lesson which I liked was how to be more anti fragile. It talked about creating more options, by devoting time in your passion, taking small risks for increasing your experience and to get rid of the things which makes us more fragile.\n\nBefore reading this book I felt that there would be some manoeuvre to follow for finding your ikigai, but there is just overview of many therapies which left me little unsatisfied and disappointed. There were few things like proverbs, quotes and traditions from centritains which I found were not really required. There is no rocket science written in this book but some of the facts are eye opening.\n\nP. S . And seriously I wish I could learn sun salutation and other exercise by reading.\n\nOverall I will say it‚Äôs a easy, simple read for beginners for setting up small goals.\n\nOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.\n‚Äî‚Äî-Japanese proverb\n\nBook starts with this proverb and this literally summarises the book.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tzySoukOL._SY88.jpg,3,little hyped ! !,"\ n ikigai \ nthe japanese secret to a long and happy life \ nby hector garcia and francesc miralles \ n \ ni will be confessing by saying that i bought this book just because of its attractive cover , such a soothing color combination which itself calmed me . \ n \ nthis book is all about finding your passion in life , your ‚Äú ikigai ‚Äù which will help you to live a happy , content , active and long life . it talks about art of staying young while growing old , about relaxing , about not running behind materialistic things , how to improve your performance in daily routine and to stay focused . \ n \ none of the best lesson which i liked was how to be more anti fragile . it talked about creating more options , by devoting time in your passion , taking small risks for increasing your experience and to get rid of the things which makes us more fragile . \ n \ nbefore reading this book i felt that there would be some manoeuvre to follow for finding your ikigai , but there is just overview of many therapies which left me little unsatisfied and disappointed . there were few things like proverbs , quotes and traditions from centritains which i found were not really required . there is no rocket science written in this book but some of the facts are eye opening . \ n \ np . s . and seriously i wish i could learn sun salutation and other exercise by reading . \ n \ noverall i will say it 's a easy , simple read for beginners for setting up small goals . \ n \ nonly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years . \ n ‚Äî ‚Äî - japanese proverb \ n \ nbook starts with this proverb and this literally summarises the book . \ n",252.jpg

So far so good !! Heavy Duty Battery. Top specs at a reasonable price.,"\n I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.\nThis phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.\n\nNow coming to the phone :\n\nPros :-\n1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.\n2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.\n3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.\n4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.\n5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.\n6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.\nOther conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nNow coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :\n1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.\n2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.\n3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.\n\nOverall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy.

I bought this Mi led TV 4C Pro one week ago.\n\nTalk about build quality it's made by plastic &amp; good enough at this price point. It's light weight &amp; design is almost similar to Mi LED TV 4A.\n\nPicture quality is not the very best but it's good. Resolution is 1366√ó768 means it is only a HD ready panel. I checked on tv upto 4k videos on YouTube &amp; full hd videos on USB drive was playing smoothly but after 720p no major difference in quality of video on higher resolution. I feel little bit better quality display in comparison of Mi LED TV 4A. One thing to notice on display that corners are little but darker when your screen is white. Overall picture quality is acceptable.\n\nSound output is almost same as Mi Led TV 4A. It comes with 10w√ó2 two speakers setup &amp; it is loud &amp; clear upto 70% volume. I feel little bit distortion on high volume but I say it is one the best the sound output in TVs in this price segment.\n\nNow talk software/os it runs on Android 8.1 &amp; Patchwall. Android gives you freedom to download tons of apps from play store which is already available on tv. You can set up your android smartphone with tv. Share your smartphone content to tv easily through Google cast because it comes with Chromecast built in. Youtube works flawlessly if internet speed is good. Patchwall gives lots of content from many online content partners some are free and some paid but it's good.\n\nTv comes with lots of connectivity features. Here is 3√óHDMI, 2√óUSB, AV, 3.5mm audio out, lan port, Bluetooth &amp; wifi.\nTv comes with a bluetooth enabled 12 button voice remote which is very useful you can use is from any direction &amp; use voice command from dedicated mic available on remote.\n\nTable mount comes in box but you need to pay 399 for wall mount installation.\n\nOverall it is a value for money Smart LED Android TV by Xiaomi.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EerbKsaHL._SY88.jpg,3,pocket friendly android tv by xiaomi,"\ n i was using mi led tv 4a from last 6-7 months . i bought this mi led tv 4c pro one week ago . \ n \ ntalk about build quality it 's made by plastic & good enough at this price point . it 's light weight & design is almost similar to mi led tv 4a . \ n \ npicture quality is not the very best but it 's good . resolution is 1366 √ó 768 means it is only a hd ready panel . i checked on tv upto 4k videos on youtube & full hd videos on usb drive was playing smoothly but after 720p no major difference in quality of video on higher resolution . i feel little bit better quality display in comparison of mi led tv 4a . one thing to notice on display that corners are little but darker when your screen is white . overall picture quality is acceptable . \ n \ nsound output is almost same as mi led tv 4a . it comes with 10w √ó 2 two speakers setup & it is loud & clear upto 70 % volume . i feel little bit distortion on high volume but i say it is one the best the sound output in tvs in this price segment . \ n \ nnow talk software / os it runs on android 8 . 1 & patchwall . android gives you freedom to download tons of apps from play store which is already available on tv . you can set up your android smartphone with tv . share your smartphone content to tv easily through google cast because it comes with chromecast built in . youtube works flawlessly if internet speed is good . patchwall gives lots of content from many online content partners some are free and some paid but it 's good . \ n \ ntv comes with lots of connectivity features . here is 3 √ó hdmi , 2 √ó usb , av , 3 . 5 mm audio out , lan port , bluetooth & wifi . \ ntv comes with a bluetooth enabled 12 button voice remote which is very useful you can use is from any direction & use voice command from dedicated mic available on remote . \ n \ ntable mount comes in box but you need to pay 399 for wall mount installation . \ n \ noverall it is a value for money smart led android tv by xiaomi . \ n",2633.jpg

Plug your echo on and download alexa on your phone.\n\n2. From the alexa app, pair your phone with your echo device first to establish the first connection between your phone and your echo.\n\n3. We need to set up wifi access on echo so that alexa on echo can be alive. To do that, after you've paired your echo with your phone, proceed to where you can search for the available wifi networks. Connect to your wifi network on alexa app by entering your wifi password. Post this, your echo should be connected to wifi and alexa on your echo should be online.\n\n4. You can pair alexa with any bluetooth speakers if you have any. You may also pair your phone with your echo with bluetooth so that you may play your local AV via your echo. Yes you can play music from phone. To connect to bluetooth, enable pairing on your echo. To do that, command, 'Alexa pair' and you should hear alexa respond. When she does that, she is ready to pair; open your phone's bluetooth settings and connect to your echo. The connection should now be successful.\n\n5. Develop skills for alexa and keep interracting with her so that your relationship blooms. Any relationships are funny to understand at the beggining. Believe me, there is a deep meaning and truth in my previous sentence.\n\nAs for the performance part, there's no compromise from my point of view and your echo dot can easily compete with most advanced dedicated speakers of its size.\nThe bass is pretty decent. The treble is at a good feel as well. At full volume, there is no screeching or dampening. The sound is premium than previous echo dot.\nEcho plus will obviosuly nail it, way better than dot, so please do not compare plus with dot. Both peform exceptionally based on budget.\nYou cannot wire in audio to your echo dot (nevertheless, you can bluetooth in your audio), but you can wire out to external speakers. When wiring to your external speakers maintain 15cms for optimal performance.\n\nI hope this helps.

I am not gonna into a detailed review, but I would like to highlight some points that were raised by some other reviewers.\n1. It is ver2 of the hardware, and yes, it's designed to be sold in the US. But it does not matter since this is not a modem, but a router. It works perfectly when plugged into the lan port of your existing router/modem.\n2. The range for 5GHz is not terrible. It is much lower than that of 2.4GHz but that is to be expected.\n3. Speed on 5GHz throughout my double storey house does not drop beyond 50 Mbps. So, I've disabled the 2.4 band.\n\nI have this router plugged into my ZTE Router/Modem that was provided to me by my ISP (Connect Broadband, Punjab). The modem has a GE port.

But the marketing and customer service after sales by MI provides assurance although this is a very affordabe low entry priced TV in Android market.\n\nThe setup of this fully featured Android TV is simple and effective and the pre installed apps works flawlessly. Although the video playback through wifi and chromecast even in high speed network had some playback issues in downloaded apps which is negligible if u dont install too many apps.\n\nThe best part of this MI TV is the remote which is simple and best for Internet TV users. Since its an Android based TV most people who buy this would essentially use more of the Internet content hence this remote which is simliar to Amazon Fire TV Stick is absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe only thing that needs some improvement is the Sound quality. No doubt that the speakers are loud but the voice clarity is not that clear having used to the other TV brands which cost thrice as much as this MI Android TV. For a start to start using Android fearures in a TV that too in this price segment its easily the best Android TV in the market current if u are willing to spend some money on a quality sound bar for better quality sound.\n\nBought it at a price of Rs. 12,499 without the instant discount on card payment. But if Rs. 1500 is reduced the price of Rs. 10,999 is an absoutele delight for every person who decides to but this TV with all those interesting features provided which works best as promised.

Therefore, if you see that it's too liquidy, it's GOOD. It signifies that no emulsifiers had been used, which other companies such as Sundrop and Disano use.

But my secondary router which was MI 3c stopped working which was used as a repeater. I wanted a router which I could use as a repeater or as wifi extender with my existing tplink c20. This router doesn't have a straightforward mentioning about using it as a wifi repeater or extender but it does have the WDS capability.\nIt took me 15 mins to figure out where the WDS enabling option was situated, after that I tried to set it up as a repeater or extender and it took me 3 hours and believe me I thought I was a techie.

I have been using TP Link's Wifi adapter for years so it was a natural choice. Eventually I settled for the C6 as the A6 offered no additional features and C80 and higher had a significantly higher price.\n\nAnyhow this is my initial review, which I will update if anything changes -\n\nBuild - Decent Quality. It's entirely plastic but looks durable. The shiny top surface is a finger magnet but then you won't be handling your router everyday. It is very light and can be balanced on narrow surfaces. Antennas are sturdy and maintain position if the router is moved or shaken quickly.\n\nRating - 5/5\n\nSetup - A bit tricky, this one. I'm on a Static IP FTTH connection so I assumed juet inputing values (IP, Gateway, Subnet, etc) will do the trick. However, it did not. Had to call up customer care and they asked me to change the Primary DNS. From experience I believe there was a MAC lock involved which they unlocked during the call but I can't be sure. Anyway it took about an hour and half to set every thing up. This isn't TP-LINK's fault.\n\nWhat is their fault is that MAC spoofing doesn't seem to work. So if your ISP isn't responding you may be stuck.\n\nRating - 4/5\n\nRange and Signal Strength - Both are miles ahead of my 3C. I have a three storied house with thick 45-year old brick walls. Even on the third storey (with router on the ground floor) I could get a signal. Not possible with my 3c. Of course it's the 2.4GHz one and not 5Ghz but it's there.\n\nSpeed wise 5GHz is the king snd everyone knows that. Within the room and in the next room it works pretty good. Beyond that 2.4GHz seems to work well.\n\nOne grouse I have is that ""Smart"" Connection isn't good. Smart allows your device to connect based on the connection that gets the highest speed in that range. But with Smart on my adapter (from the same brand) gave miserable 560Kbps speeds on a 130Mbps connection. This with the adapter stuck to the computer on which the router was placed.\n\nSeparating the two bands by turning off Smart resulted in a huge improvement. 2.4GHz gives up to 80 Mbps in the same room while 5Ghz gives the full 130Mbps. One floor above I get 30-40Mbps. On the second floor it falls to 10-12Mbps.\n\nSo the antenna and radio are great, but the software needs to be improved.\n\nRating - 4/5\n\nBells and Whistles - The router boasts of MU-MIMO and beam forming. Turning the former on improved my connection speed and stability by around 5-10% on the ground and first floors. Beyond that no noticeable difference could be felt.\n\nHaven't tried other features like VPN etc.\n\nRating - 5/5\n\nConclusion - Compared to the 3C this router actually allows me to enjoy the FTTH speeds I pay for. The hardware is impeccable and sturdy. The software is useful but needs some back end tweaking in the ""Smart"" department. That aside it's one of the most VFM routers under 3K for anyone with a 100Mbps connection or higher.\n\nOverall Rating - 4.5/5\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kRGFiFmvL._SY88.jpg,3,good speeds and sturdy build but needs software improvements,"\ n having burnt my fingers with a single band mi router 3c , i decided to double my budget and go for a decent router from a reputed brand . i have been using tp link 's wifi adapter for years so it was a natural choice . eventually i settled for the c6 as the a6 offered no additional features and c80 and higher had a significantly higher price . \ n \ nanyhow this is my initial review , which i will update if anything changes - \ n \ nbuild - decent quality . it 's entirely plastic but looks durable . the shiny top surface is a finger magnet but then you wo n't be handling your router everyday . it is very light and can be balanced on narrow surfaces . antennas are sturdy and maintain position if the router is moved or shaken quickly . \ n \ nrating - 5/5 \ n \ nsetup - a bit tricky , this one . i 'm on a static ip ftth connection so i assumed juet inputing values ( ip , gateway , subnet , etc ) will do the trick . however , it did not . had to call up customer care and they asked me to change the primary dns . from experience i believe there was a mac lock involved which they unlocked during the call but i can't be sure . anyway it took about an hour and half to set every thing up . this is n't tp-link 's fault . \ n \ nwhat is their fault is that mac spoofing does n't seem to work . so if your isp is n't responding you may be stuck . \ n \ nrating - 4/5 \ n \ nrange and signal strength - both are miles ahead of my 3c . i have a three storied house with thick 45 - year old brick walls . even on the third storey ( with router on the ground floor ) i could get a signal . not possible with my 3c . of course it 's the 2 . 4 ghz one and not 5ghz but it 's there . \ n \ nspeed wise 5ghz is the king snd everyone knows that . within the room and in the next room it works pretty good . beyond that 2 . 4 ghz seems to work well . \ n \ none grouse i have is that "" smart "" connection is n't good . smart allows your device to connect based on the connection that gets the highest speed in that range . but with smart on my adapter ( from the same brand ) gave miserable 560kbps speeds on a 130mbps connection . this with the adapter stuck to the computer on which the router was placed . \ n \ nseparating the two bands by turning off smart resulted in a huge improvement . 2 . 4 ghz gives up to 80 mbps in the same room while 5ghz gives the full 130mbps . one floor above i get 30-40 mbps . on the second floor it falls to 10-12 mbps . \ n \ nso the antenna and radio are great , but the software needs to be improved . \ n \ nrating - 4/5 \ n \ nbells and whistles - the router boasts of mu-mimo and beam forming . turning the former on improved my connection speed and stability by around 5-10 % on the ground and first floors . beyond that no noticeable difference could be felt . \ n \ nhave n't tried other features like vpn etc . \ n \ nrating - 5/5 \ n \ nconclusion - compared to the 3c this router actually allows me to enjoy the ftth speeds i pay for . the hardware is impeccable and sturdy . the software is useful but needs some back end tweaking in the "" smart "" department . that aside it 's one of the most vfm routers under 3k for anyone with a 100mbps connection or higher . \ n \ noverall rating - 4 . 5 / 5 \ n",3408.jpg

Waste of money and time! üòë,"\n Edit: The third pic shows you what I had to go through, to get the phone repaired from Samsung service centre!! No social distancing, and many were not wearing masks properly! Read on...\n\nI wondered how Samsung is able to sell these mobiles (M series) at such an affordable prices competing with Mi, Oppo, and Vivo! Now I know the secret, it is done by lowering the ‚Äúquality‚Äù! The M31 I bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months! It started as a small blue ‚Äúdot‚Äù at the left corner and grown to an ‚Äúinch wide‚Äù blue patch on the screen! Boom, within a week, you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across. See the images.\n\nWhen we visited the Samsung service centre, traveling for about 80kms, the reception was extremely poor and rude! The person standing at the store entrance said ‚Äúthis is not covered under warranty‚Äù without even having a technician checking what is the problem! Basically looks like they are all trained to say that line. When we insisted to check what is the problem, the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin (apparently it is a very minor one, that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses), that we never understood. Another thing I noticed is, most of the people at the service centre are with their ‚ÄúSamsung M series‚Äù mobiles in hand, which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them!!\n\nWe had to give the phone for display replacement, that costed us another ~6K on top of the 17K we spent for this! I could have bought Oneplus Nord by spending another 5K on top!!

In fact, i will give it 6 stars, as i already gave 5 to Dairymilk spread.\n\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\nDairy Milk Spread Vs Hersheys Vs Nutella\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nPersonally, I found Dairy Milk spread to be slightly better than Hershey‚Äôs owing to the reasons below. But again it‚Äôs slightly costly compared to Hershey‚Äôs.\n\n1. Thicker consistency spread\n2. More chocolaty taste (more like a simple version of dairy milk chocolate)\n\nFurther, i found Nutella better than Dairymilk, owing to reasons below. Again here, it's further costly.\n\n1. Rich cocoa or chocolate flavor. Not just Dairymilk taste.\n2. Uniform &amp; balanced consistency. Dairymilk spreads consistency was non-uniform and at times way too thick to spread.\n\n‚ñ∂ Arranging them from BEST ‚Üí WORST in different domains:\n\nCost Front (Price per g): Hersheys (0.74) - DairyMilk (1.00) - Nutella (1.10)\nTaste Front: Nutella - DairyMilk - Hersheys\nBalanced consistency: Nutella - DairyMilk - Hersheys\n\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\nFinal VERDICT\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nNutella is any time recommended over other spreads if you could go with the cost. Its balanced spread with rich taste which won't ever disappoint any of cocoa flavor lover.\n\n‚ñ∂ Many people comment on the sugar content of spreads, but these are meant to be that way else you would end up applying more of it to have the taste. Also reducing it will have a significant impact on cost.\n\n‚ñ∂ You may try all of Hershey‚Äôs, Nutella and Dairy milk and then finalize your taste.

The binding of pages is not good. For the product I would give 2-3 out of 5. But as the heading suggests it's a book review\n\nLet's start with a fun fact. Do you know this book was published in 1999 when the world was worrying about the Y2K apocalypse, Jeff Keller wrote this gem of a book before entering the modern era of crazy 20th Century.\nAttitude is something which is never ever thought in books, it is something which an individual learns and adapts from his/her surroundings. Starting from family, teachers and friends, each and everyone in your life will influence and unknowingly manipulate your thoughts. What the author is trying to say in the book over a course of 12 well crafted chapters is that one has always control of his/her attitude so why not channelize the enter focus of attitude towards positivity and self belief so that we are able to perform to the maximum potential. What I loved about the book was the fact that there were these deep meaningful proverbs and motivational lines written throughout the book quoting famous people so that you read them and feel energized and motivated with same. The author is not afraid to share his story stating how painfully miserable and depressed he was working as a full time lawyer. Something most of us are going through in this state of life wondering is it worth to slog into the office just to realize that in the end it was certainly not worth it. The author has written the book in the most simplest of language and explained some beautiful concepts to change one's attitude from a pessimist to an optimist. Something I will try to implement personally in my life. All in all I would not write anything from the book and potray that I am englightened and changed after reading this book.\n\nWhat I would say is that, if you are exhausted from daily routine, just take a break from netflix, YouTube, hotstar and what not and read this book. It can do wonders for you and might change your life for good.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EGCgcw1QL._SY88.jpg,3,book review . .,"\ n amazon delivery bang on . the binding of pages is not good . for the product i would give 2-3 out of 5 . but as the heading suggests it 's a book review \ n \ nlet 's start with a fun fact . do you know this book was published in 1999 when the world was worrying about the y2k apocalypse , jeff keller wrote this gem of a book before entering the modern era of crazy 20th century . \ nattitude is something which is never ever thought in books , it is something which an individual learns and adapts from his / her surroundings . starting from family , teachers and friends , each and everyone in your life will influence and unknowingly manipulate your thoughts . what the author is trying to say in the book over a course of 12 well crafted chapters is that one has always control of his / her attitude so why not channelize the enter focus of attitude towards positivity and self belief so that we are able to perform to the maximum potential . what i loved about the book was the fact that there were these deep meaningful proverbs and motivational lines written throughout the book quoting famous people so that you read them and feel energized and motivated with same . the author is not afraid to share his story stating how painfully miserable and depressed he was working as a full time lawyer . something most of us are going through in this state of life wondering is it worth to slog into the office just to realize that in the end it was certainly not worth it . the author has written the book in the most simplest of language and explained some beautiful concepts to change one 's attitude from a pessimist to an optimist . something i will try to implement personally in my life . all in all i would not write anything from the book and potray that i am englightened and changed after reading this book . \ n \ nwhat i would say is that , if you are exhausted from daily routine , just take a break from netflix , youtube , hotstar and what not and read this book . it can do wonders for you and might change your life for good . \ n",36.jpg

Had to switch back to JBL.\n\nSo here's the detailed review...\n\nPros :\n\n1. Sound : Too great. Had to put my sound bar to half. Quality doesn't lessens even at the max sound. Bass is superb too.\n\n2. Built quality : marvelous built. One thing I like about JBL is that they make slight changes even if the launched model is way old. Built quality has been upgraded. Only thing I wanted was L shaped lead but it's fine.\n\n3. Noise cancellation : great noise cancellation. You can totally rely on this. Once you put on everything will seem great about it.\n\n4. Ear comfort : fits too well. You won't need to adjust them once you've put them on.\n\nCons : apart from the normal shaped lead I didn't found any cons about it. It will last for more than an year and can even work for more than 2 years if handled carefully.\n\nHope this will help you decide.\nHave a nice day!!\n,0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YzqVhk3DL._SY88.jpg,3,do n't think . just buy ! ! !,\ n superb product ! ! this is my 2nd time buying these earphones . before these i purchased sennheiser cx 180 street 2 but in just 3 months the sound quality dropped to minimum . had to switch back to jbl . \ n \ nso here 's the detailed review . . . \ n \ npros :\ n \ n1 . sound : too great . had to put my sound bar to half . quality does n't lessens even at the max sound . bass is superb too . \ n \ n2 . built quality : marvelous built . one thing i like about jbl is that they make slight changes even if the launched model is way old . built quality has been upgraded . only thing i wanted was l shaped lead but it 's fine . \ n \ n3 . noise cancellation : great noise cancellation . you can totally rely on this . once you put on everything will seem great about it . \ n \ n4 . ear comfort : fits too well . you wo n't need to adjust them once you 've put them on . \ n \ ncons : apart from the normal shaped lead i did n't found any cons about it . it will last for more than an year and can even work for more than 2 years if handled carefully . \ n \ nhope this will help you decide . \ nhave a nice day ! ! \ n,2160.jpg

Hope I start implementing the main principle of the book right from here -how monk think at this moment ??(to write a review for the book now ). Myself being a doctor , leading a relatively more stressful phase at this Covid pandemic time , mainly due to fear of acquiring Covid disease to myself , my family members, friends , and others in the society , I am very glad to have read this book. Apart from the normal times, these Covid times have put more of stress , burden , agony and fear to all health care workers in various aspects of their life and draining them physically and mentally. There are also cases reported in healthy people who with the fear of getting covid positive or who are tested positive succumbed to death just due to their mental agony and fear of Covid . So apart from the treatment by medications and vaccines , it requires lot of mental Courage &amp; emotional support to fight and overcome such diseases . So this book in particular is must a read for everyone , to gain mental stability and positivity especially in these pandemic situations. Apart from the social distance precautions, mask wear, Diet , personal hygiene and immune booster supplementation , this book can work as a mental booster to everyone of us .\n\nThe author has beautifully divided the book into three parts - Let Go, Grow and Give , with each of the part having various chapters described under. Right from the first page , the author takes through to a wonderful ride to an enlightened atmosphere driven by a positive energy vehicle . There are various highlighted phrases , quotes and sayings described throughout the book and can be read many a times to develop positive Vibes.There is lot of focus on personality Development , positive emotions and habits described in the book which are motivating . There are beautiful Small Stories described in the book which are given as examples to apply to ourselves .There are real life incidents of the authors lifestyle at the ashram with the monks which makes us get connected and also adding liveliness to the book . The core of the book mainly deals with the different kinds of meditations to train our mind for peace and finding purpose everyday. There‚Äôs lot to be experienced internally rather than externally. Hence I am unable to put my book experience in the words .\nApart from name, fame , money , luxuries and etc , there‚Äôs lot to be dealt internally which gives more happiness to us such as by our kindness , gratitude and service which are beautifully explained in the book . The main thing which I learnt the most in the book is to find happiness internally and being grateful for what we have in our life .\n\nI would recommend this book to my friends , family members and also people who are mentally sick , so they would go through this wonderful journey of positive energy . Also in this pandemic situation, where home isolation is the main treatment for many of us , this book is a must read to improve our mental , physical and emotional stability .\nWords wouldn‚Äôt suffice to express my gratitude or thanks to the author Jayshetty and his team for delivering such a masterpiece book to the world and enhancing many lives . Words are actually short for me to describe the experience I had while reading the book . May you write many more books like these and transform as many as Possible to the positive energy.

I really need a smart watch which can track my daily activity, give me a stylish look and provide me various notifications. As usual my first thought was about apple watch.\n\nWhy I preferred noise colorfit pro 2?\nApple watch is very nice, which is a real smart watch. But problem is poor battery life.\n\nDo you really think of charging ur apple watch daily?\nIn today‚Äôs life already I hv wireless earpods, loud speaker and smartphone which need to be charged daily. Really I don‚Äôt want to add one more thing to the list.\nDo you really need a smart watch to answer calls or reply messages when ur phn is in ur pocket or near by (bcoz if phn is not nearby then these features will not work)? If yes then believe me u r too lazy ??.\n\nPros of colorfit pro 2: stylish look, working flawlessly with my iPhone. I can receive all notifications, read messages, control music (working nicely with gaana app, even if gaana app is not open, by clicking play button songs can be played). The activity tracker is also working fine. Good battery life.\n\nCons: Only 5 watch faces (request to noise to update number of watch faces which ll make this watch awesome)\nUnder bright sunshine, screen is hardly visible (the only thing with respect to which amazfit bip lite is the winner)\n\nVerdict: U can definitely try this watch though it is really not a smartwatch. In India, smartwatch technology is at nascent stage. So don‚Äôt expect much as compared to smartphones. Presently Smartwatch technology in India is like smartphone technology that was 5years ago.

It will boost your soul and spirits, fill your heart with longing and happiness &amp; will take you back to the time when life was simpler and fun.\n\nIt is a collection of 22 short stories told by Ajji to her grandchildren Raghu, Meenu,Anand, Krishna and their neighbourhood friends. The grandchildren come to their grandparents place during their summer vacations. Their grandparents house is away from the hustle-bustle of the city life; surrounded by greenery and open field. The children however are most excited about the stories that Ajji is going to tell them during their stay with her.\n\nThe stories told by the grandmother are short &amp; sweet moral stories. These stories deal on wide variety of topics such as importance of:\nüìç hard work &amp;honesty\nüìçbeing down to earth, being helpful &amp; humble &amp; content &amp; loyal\nüìçhaving presence of mind\nüìçloving people unconditionally\nAll the stories will fill you up with hope and that feeling of content that you used to feel if your grandparents also told you stories.\n\nThe narration is very effective as you will be able to retain the stories for a long time. The tone is full of warmth. The book is woven in a way to make you feel nostalgic.The book brought back strong memories of my childhood when my brother &amp; me used to travel to my native place with our parents to meet our grandparents during summer &amp; winter breaks. Those memories were overwhelming. The smile that used to break on my Amma's &amp; Dadaji's face are images that I would cherish for my lifetime.

The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.\n2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.\n3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.\n4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.\n5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.\n6. Battery life is quite very good.\n7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.\n8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.\n9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.\nCons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn‚Äôt expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.\n2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.\n3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.\n4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.\n5. The charging is a bit slow.\n6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn‚Äôt expected with this processor and android version.\n7. The sound output could have been more.\n8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.\n9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.\nThe phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage.

It was cold during that time so these provided a good snugly warm feel but soon i noticed that as time passed temp started to rise resulting in sweat during summertime. I have to take them off after 1 hr of usage and wipe sweat which is pretty inconvenient. I would also like to add the fact that my ears are big and due to that i can't wear them for long without having pain. If you have big ears just get extra pair of pads. Also i would like to add that you can not listen comfortablely if you are outside.\n\n2}SOUND QUALITY\nThe most important part!! If you are upgrading from 4-5 k(INR) range then you will feel considerable upgrade. Sound stange is not big everything feels like its ""in your head"" . Note that sound separation is good not sound stage. Now lets come to detail retrieval, highs are boosted which make them strike a bit hard in some tracks like edm which is boosted already for ""majority"" but if you listen to guitar acoustic tracks you are gonna love it. Mids are recessed and not warm in short mids lack energy. While sub bass is adequately ""boomy"". Bass near low mid region is tight and edm tracks sound great in that region. Using eq is highly recommended if you listen to variety of genres.\n\n3} PRICING\nI got mine for 8 k (INR) which was a steal if you are getting around that price go for them. They provide a good value for that price.\n\n4} EASE OF TRAVEL\nThis is the part where M-50x's shine real well. There foldable design provide great use during traveling.

Some of those were gifted by well-meaning friends. Some of them were books I bought on an impulse. Then there were books that I had waited years to read only to find them unworthy of all those years of patience. But this book by Yuval Noah Harari tops the list. Just imagine reading a book that all your friends were going gaga about, only to find that there is nothing worthwhile in it and wondering whether you are really a good reader at all, now that you don‚Äôt even like a book that the whole world around you seems to love!\n\nLet‚Äôs clear a few things first, before you think of bashing me up. This is a commendable effort by Mr. Harari to summarize the whole history of mankind and its evolutionary tale. During the initial pages, I too thought that this will be one of the best reads on anthropology. But this book promises a lot only to deceive. We statisticians use the term confirmation bias, which means the tendency to favor and present only those information that are supportive to one‚Äôs beliefs. This book is full of them. Harari had decided to present all that is wicked and weak about Homo Sapiens and he has succeeded to a large extent.\n\nNot that I am complaining. I for one have never held the notion that we humans are special beings sitting atop the food chain, placed there by a favorable god who created us all in his (or, is it a ‚Äòher‚Äô?) own image. I think of us as a different species of apes that managed to evolve a little quicker than our cousins. Despite our use of advanced languages, costly clothes and snazzy gadgets, internally we remain the beasts that roamed the vast forests once. I see nothing special about being human. This book helped cement that belief in my mind by discussing the idiocies and idiosyncrasies of our species as a whole.\n\nBut that‚Äôs just about it. This book isn‚Äôt ‚Äòa brief history of humankind‚Äô, but the opinions of Mr. Harari about the various aspects of human evolution. This isn‚Äôt a chronological history in the lines of ‚ÄòWhat on Earth Happened?‚Äô by Christopher Lloyd or ‚ÄòA Short History of Nearly Everything‚Äô by Bill Bryson, both of which I found to be far more informative and interesting than this one. This is both a philosophical take and passing of judgments by Mr. Harari on what he considers to be the vital cogs of human evolution, namely Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution &amp; Scientific Revolution. There is nothing that you end up learning that you already didn‚Äôt learn, especially in case you had read those two aforementioned books.\n\nSorry, dear friends.

USB Type B is an older port and is replaced by mini usb 5 pin B which this mic would now come with. Mine was usb mini as mentioned and I was successfully able to register my product serial number with Logitech (Since Blue company is now acquired by Logitech). Even Blue Sherpa Companion app was able to find my mic with correct serial number. So relax it is original only.\nNow for the review part-\n1. Amazon packaging was pathetic the box was damaged, they sent me the box in a white amazon polythene instead of packing it inside a cardboard box. Not sure what happened here usually Amazon pack things nicely so I guess it was the seller (Bought it from prime seller). However luckily my mic was not damaged. (Touchwood)\n2. Talking about mic itself, it is simply amazing, It captures the lows, the mids and the highs perfectly without any problems.\n3. Noise cancellation is okay, not best for sure but very decent, live streaming should not be a problem at all and if you are using it for voice overs you can post process it in either audacity or premier pro to make it sound like a professional studio mic.\n4. The wire sent with the mic was black for some reason even though my mic was white but it still looks absolutely stunning sitting on your desk, clubs very well with the setup, definitely an eye catcher.\n5. Stand provided with it is sturdy and has nice rubber feet so it will not slip off easily and will hold it‚Äôs position.\n Overall a great mic even in 2020 for beginners and growing youtubers, definitely gives you a professional edge without putting a whole in your pocket. I bought it during covid so costed me around 5k but you should be able to find a good deal on this, though it‚Äôs still worth it at 5k considering the sound it‚Äôs amazing sound quality. Would have given 5 stars but had to cut 1 star for packaging.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a condenser mic which is easy to setup and is bang for your buck, look no further and buy this. You will not regret.\n\nThanks for taking time out to read my review.
