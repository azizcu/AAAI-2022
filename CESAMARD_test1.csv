But not so good for the price.,"\n &nbsp;Hi, I read the other reviews of this mic on amazon, YouTube. Mostly all are good so, I decided to buy it.\nFirst time, an already opened box was delivered, so I asked for replacement. Amazon quickly replaced my product and I received a packed one this time.\n\nThis mic is not at all good for the price. The sound recorded is bad and low quality. It appears to be recorded on cheap quality mic present in earphones. My normal Logitech USB headset mic is working better than this.\n\nAbout noise cancellation:\nYes it is cancelling the noise. But it is very harsh. During noise cancellation, it also reduces the quality of original voice. And thus we get a low quality voice. Unfortunately there is no option to turn off noise cancellation.\n\nRecommendation:\nIf we want quality, I would suggest go for a good quality headset. It's voice would be clearer than this.\n\nCons:\n- Very harsh noise cancellation, which reduces quality of actual voice.\n- 20 feel cable is so long. (it is both a pro and a con)\n- A little on heavier side\n- Voice quality is not good.\n\nPros:\n- 20 Feet cable\n- Comes with 5.5 adapter to plugin into amplifier and other instruments\n- Build quality is amazing\n- Comes with a clip and cushion.\n- Comes with a small pouch.\n- Can be used on a camera.\n- Noise cancellation\n\nI've decided to return the product.\n",1,sadness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k8Lg5K0lL._SY88.jpg,4,it 's okay . but not so good for the price .,"\ n hi , i read the other reviews of this mic on amazon , youtube . mostly all are good so , i decided to buy it . \ nfirst time , an already opened box was delivered , so i asked for replacement . amazon quickly replaced my product and i received a packed one this time . \ n \ nthis mic is not at all good for the price . the sound recorded is bad and low quality . it appears to be recorded on cheap quality mic present in earphones . my normal logitech usb headset mic is working better than this . \ n \ nabout noise cancellation :\ nyes it is cancelling the noise . but it is very harsh . during noise cancellation , it also reduces the quality of original voice . and thus we get a low quality voice . unfortunately there is no option to turn off noise cancellation . \ n \ nrecommendation :\ nif we want quality , i would suggest go for a good quality headset . it 's voice would be clearer than this . \ n \ ncons :\ n - very harsh noise cancellation , which reduces quality of actual voice . \ n - 20 feel cable is so long .

I'll share with you how my journey buying this SSD was and what I learnt and what you should know.\n\nMX500 is not the most budget-friendly and entry-level SSD out there (there is WD Green, Crucial BX500, Kingston A400 and some others) but I would say it's excellent for the price. Before the MX500, I had purchased its younger sibling, BX500, and I noticed+learnt a couple of things with that.\n1. Similar transfer speeds at around 390 MB/s\n2. SLC caching (16 GB for 240 GB variant, 32 GB for 480 GB variant and so on). What it means is that after writing 16 GB, 32 GB and so on, write speed would drop significantly because instead of writing to the SLC cache of the drive, data would be written directly to the TLC. SLC is way faster than TLC (around 400 MB/s write to the drive while using SLC cache and around 50-80 MB/s once SLC cache is full).\nThis SLC cache varies from SSD to SSD and can be seen even on premium SSDs that cost 20k-30k (it brings down the cost, otherwise those drives would cost over a lakh or something!)\nAlso, the BX500 had a 3-year warranty (MX500 has a 5-year warranty) and lower TBW (Terabytes Written) rating than the MX500. So I returned my BX500 because the performance was an issue and chose to go with MX500.\n\nPerformance of the MX500 is superb. I have it hooked to my MacBook Air using a Transcend StoreJet SATA to USB adaptor thingy just like I did with the BX500. I transferred around 80 GB data from my MacBook to the MX500, and it moved files and folders at about 350 MB/s to the drive throughout the transfer, with speed drop to around 150 MB/s 5-6 times for 3-4 seconds each time (that was because it was moving tiny files and folders). Crucial says that the MX500 has a Dynamic Write Acceleration on their website. Well, it clearly works!\n\nSo should you buy an MX500? It depends. If you are planning to buy an SSD that will probably last for years, if you plan to write lots of data to the drive, if you need an SSD as a scratch disk (for photo and video editing) or if you want an SSD that's good but costs less than the Samsung SSDs, then go for MX500. I'm building a PC in a couple of weeks and I'll use the MX500 as the boot device in that.\nHowever, if you have an old laptop that is extremely slow and takes forever to start, maybe you have desktop with some old, failing hard drive and you are looking for an SSD, and you are not a heavy user (that is you'll browse the web, write emails and do stuff like that), then save some money (if you wish) and go for the BX500.\n\nAbout the delivery of the product, I got an empty box when I ordered the MX500 from Amazon. Once I got it and saw that the item was missing, I brought it to Amazon's notice, and they said they would take two days to conduct an investigation. However, when I called the next day, I got to know that they concluded that I could get a replacement or a refund. The process for replacement wasn't very smooth (it took about a week to get a replacement unit), but in the end, I got the product, and the product is pretty much excellent like I had expected, hence the five stars.\n\nAnother important thing that I want to mention is that the MRP in the box of the 500 GB variant of the MX500 is Rs 8,400 (screenshot attached) and at the time of writing this review on 30 June 2020, there are a couple of sellers on Amazon named ""Cart2India Online"" and ""Cart2India SLP"" who are selling the product at twice the price (Rs 14,358). There are some other sellers also who list the MRP as Rs 9,000 or 10,000 and then say they are providing a discount of Rs 4,000 or Rs 5,000 when in fact, they are only offering a discount of Rs 2,500 or something. I especially saw this with the seller ""Gadget Buggy"". Basically, AVOID THESE SELLERS and buy from Appario Retail Private Ltd or the other Fulfilled By Amazon sellers.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mS+VsIiML._SY88.jpg,3,the perfect ssd for many even in 2020 ( also check the mrp listed by seller ),"\ n so i did n't know much about ssds before i set out to buy one . i 'll share with you how my journey buying this ssd was and what i learnt and what you should know . \ n \ nmx 500 is not the most budget-friendly and entry-level ssd out there ( there is wd green , crucial bx500 , kingston a400 and some others ) but i would say it 's excellent for the price . before the mx500 , i had purchased its younger sibling , bx500 , and i noticed + learnt a couple of things with that . \ n1 . similar transfer speeds at around 390 mb / s \ n2 . slc caching ( 16 gb for 240 gb variant , 32 gb for 480 gb variant and so on ) . what it means is that after writing 16 gb , 32 gb and so on , write speed would drop significantly because instead of writing to the slc cache of the drive , data would be written directly to the tlc . slc is way faster than tlc ( around 400 mb / s write to the drive while using slc cache and around 50-80 mb / s once slc cache is full ) . \ nthis slc cache varies from ssd to ssd and can be seen even on premium ssds that cost 20k - 30k ( it brings down the cost , otherwise those drives would cost over a lakh or something ! ) \ nalso , the bx500 had a 3 - year warranty ( mx500 has a 5 - year warranty ) and lower tbw ( terabytes written ) rating than the mx500 . so i returned my bx500 because the performance was an issue and chose to go with mx500 . \ n \ nperformance of the mx500 is superb . i have it hooked to my macbook air using a transcend storejet sata to usb adaptor thingy just like i did with the bx500 . i transferred around 80 gb data from my macbook to the mx500 , and it moved files and folders at about 350 mb / s to the drive throughout the transfer , with speed drop to around 150 mb / s 5-6 times for 3-4 seconds each time ( that was because it was moving tiny files and folders ) . crucial says that the mx500 has a dynamic write acceleration on their website . well , it clearly works ! \ n \ nso should you buy an mx500 ? it depends . if you are planning to buy an ssd that will probably last for years , if you plan to write lots of data to the drive , if you need an ssd as a scratch disk ( for photo and video editing ) or if you want an ssd that 's good but costs less than the samsung ssds , then go for mx500 . i 'm building a pc in a couple of weeks and i 'll use the mx500 as the boot device in that . \ nhowever , if you have an old laptop that is extremely slow and takes forever to start , maybe you have desktop with some old , failing hard drive and you are looking for an ssd , and you are not a heavy user ( that is you 'll browse the web , write emails and do stuff like that ) , then save some money ( if you wish ) and go for the bx500 . \ n \ nabout the delivery of the product , i got an empty box when i ordered the mx500 from amazon . once i got it and saw that the item was missing , i brought it to amazon 's notice , and they said they would take two days to conduct an investigation . however , when i called the next day , i got to know that they concluded that i could get a replacement or a refund . the process for replacement was n't very smooth ( it took about a week to get a replacement unit ) , but in the end , i got the product , and the product is pretty much excellent like i had expected , hence the five stars . \ n \ nanother important thing that i want to mention is that the mrp in the box of the 500 gb variant of the mx500 is rs 8,400 ( screenshot attached ) and at the time of writing this review on 30 june 2020 , there are a couple of sellers on amazon named "" cart 2india online "" and "" cart 2india slp "" who are selling the product at twice the price ( rs 14,358 ) . there are some other sellers also who list the mrp as rs 9,000 or 10,000 and then say they are providing a discount of rs 4,000 or rs 5,000 when in fact , they are only offering a discount of rs 2,500 or something . i especially saw this with the seller "" gadget buggy "" . basically , avoid these sellers and buy from appario retail private ltd or the other fulfilled by amazon sellers . \ n"

Do you know this book was published in 1999 when the world was worrying about the Y2K apocalypse, Jeff Keller wrote this gem of a book before entering the modern era of crazy 20th Century.\nAttitude is something which is never ever thought in books, it is something which an individual learns and adapts from his/her surroundings. Starting from family, teachers and friends, each and everyone in your life will influence and unknowingly manipulate your thoughts. What the author is trying to say in the book over a course of 12 well crafted chapters is that one has always control of his/her attitude so why not channelize the enter focus of attitude towards positivity and self belief so that we are able to perform to the maximum potential. What I loved about the book was the fact that there were these deep meaningful proverbs and motivational lines written throughout the book quoting famous people so that you read them and feel energized and motivated with same. The author is not afraid to share his story stating how painfully miserable and depressed he was working as a full time lawyer. Something most of us are going through in this state of life wondering is it worth to slog into the office just to realize that in the end it was certainly not worth it. The author has written the book in the most simplest of language and explained some beautiful concepts to change one's attitude from a pessimist to an optimist. Something I will try to implement personally in my life. All in all I would not write anything from the book and potray that I am englightened and changed after reading this book.\n\nWhat I would say is that, if you are exhausted from daily routine, just take a break from netflix, YouTube, hotstar and what not and read this book.

The price just before the sale was Rs 2,696/- but on sale, it had a lightning deal of 2,499/- and I got 10% Rs 250 additional discount for HDFC Card. In Short, I got the SSD for Rs 2249/-.\nThis SSD is worth every penny. I have a Lenovo Ideapad 320-15IKB (Type 81BG, 81BT) with basic configuration ( i5 8th gen, 8GB ram and 1TB 5400 rpm HDD). After 2 years of use, the laptop became super slow, boot time was around two minutes and it used to get stuck very often (couldn't open more than 4-5 tabs in chrome at one go). Tried every tweak youtube videos had to offer but there was no visible performance improvement. Somebody suggested to buy an SSD ( I didn't wanted to spend much on it honestly ). After searching and reading comments I finally decided to go for this one. Below is my view of this product to help you decide to make an informed choice if you wish to get one:\n1. Boot time on my machine is less than 12 seconds\n2. MS office opens as soon as you click on a file (haven't seen taking more than 3 seconds)\n3. Chrome is never stuck (can open 10-12 tabs, never tried more than that but pretty sure it can handle more)\n4. Significant time reduction in transferring a file from Pendrive, hard drive, phone\n5. 2.2k for a 240gb SSD is the best deal, can't say about the coming times as technology improves but this is the best deal you can get for now\n6. Some people have written non-satisfactory reviews on this (and they have compared it with Samsung Evo, let me tell you, I am sure that is among the best SSD available, but it comes at double the price with maybe 20% extra performance, you can do the math to figure out which is a better option when it comes to value buy)\n7. Honest opinion: If you are someone looking for an SSD that offers decent performance (8-10x better than 5400rpm HDD), and don't wanna spend too much on it then this is a product for you.\n8. And lastly, enable ""Momentum Cache"" by downloading Crucial Storage Executive which will enhance your speed upto 6GBps. (Picture 1 is without enabling Momentum Cache facility and Picture 2 is using Momentum Cache facility.)\n\nI hope this review helps you in making an informed decision on buying an SSD.\nThank you.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713mmub4hFL._SY88.jpg,3,worth purchasing,"\ n i bought my crucial 240gb ssd on 16th october 2020 during the great indian festival sale . the price just before the sale was rs 2,696 / - but on sale , it had a lightning deal of 2,499 / - and i got 10 % rs 250 additional discount for hdfc card . in short , i got the ssd for rs 2249 / - . \ nthis ssd is worth every penny . i have a lenovo ideapad 320-15 ikb ( type 81bg , 81bt ) with basic configuration ( i5 8th gen , 8gb ram and 1tb 5400 rpm hdd ) . after 2 years of use , the laptop became super slow , boot time was around two minutes and it used to get stuck very often ( could n't open more than 4-5 tabs in chrome at one go ) . tried every tweak youtube videos had to offer but there was no visible performance improvement . somebody suggested to buy an ssd ( i did n't wanted to spend much on it honestly ) . after searching and reading comments i finally decided to go for this one . below is my view of this product to help you decide to make an informed choice if you wish to get one :\ n1 . boot time on my machine is less than 12 seconds \ n2 . ms office opens as soon as you click on a file ( have n't seen taking more than 3 seconds ) \ n3 . chrome is never stuck ( can open 10-12 tabs , never tried more than that but pretty sure it can handle more ) \ n4 . significant time reduction in transferring a file from pendrive , hard drive , phone \ n5 . 2 . 2 k for a 240gb ssd is the best deal , can't say about the coming times as technology improves but this is the best deal you can get for now \ n6 . some people have written non-satisfactory reviews on this ( and they have compared it with samsung evo , let me tell you , i am sure that is among the best ssd available , but it comes at double the price with maybe 20 % extra performance , you can do the math to figure out which is a better option when it comes to value buy ) \ n7 . honest opinion : if you are someone looking for an ssd that offers decent performance (8 - 10x better than 5400rpm hdd ) , and do n't wanna spend too much on it then this is a product for you . \ n8 . and lastly , enable "" momentum cache "" by downloading crucial storage executive which will enhance your speed upto 6gbps .

According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I’ve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features.\n One of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‘picture in Picture’ in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking.\n Apple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing.\n Iphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone.\n Along with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing “continuity feature” that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier.\n Being a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but, my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available.\n",0,sadness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VwBeNuPuL._SY88.jpg,4,iphone 11

PROS.\n(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek &amp; stylish to look at.\n(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.\n(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.\n(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.\n(e) With quad camera &amp; a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.\n(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.\n(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.\n4. CONS.\n(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.\n(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.\n5. I'm satisfied with the phone &amp; the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs &amp; brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wFeW0j03L._SY88.jpg,3,a fab phone at this price !,"\ n 1 . first of all let me tell you that previously i have used moto g2 , moto g4 play & lenovo k8 note . \ n2 . i 'm writing this review after 3 days of usage , using the 128gb version . \ n3 . pros . \ n ( a ) a great delivery experience by amazon , within 24hr delivery , the phone is sleek & stylish to look at . \ n ( b ) battery backup ( 6000mah ) is just awesome . for an average user like me , it lasted for two days in a single full charge . \ n ( c ) very very smooth processor , as compared to other phones in this price range like oppo and mi . works like a flash . \ n ( d ) brand value of samsung at this price with the latest specs . \ n ( e ) with quad camera & a 64mp main camera , pretty amazing photos are clicked . the low light camera is particularly helpful . \ n ( f ) if you are a fan of amoled display , this is the phone for you . \ n ( g ) no problem of overheating while usage or charging . \ n4 . cons . \ n ( a ) with a 15w charger , it is charging slow taking almost 2 . 5 hrs for a full charge , especially when compared to oppo vooc charger . \ n ( b ) not a very rugged phone , you might need to use a back cover from day 1 . \ n5 . i 'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides . overall , i would totally recommend you to go for samsung galaxy m31 , as at this price range , with the specs & brand value of samsung , this is the best buy . :thumbs_up: \ n"

No complaints for what I got for the price I paid\nSwitching from a 7 year old Sony 21"" to a Mi TV 43"", the change in both picture and audio quality is not just noticeable, it is in your face.\nI mean the audio sounds cheap and tinny. Even my JBL Bluetooth sounds better.\nThe image quality is just about suffer-able. Also if you are used to 1080p displays like on your phone, laptop, TV with much smaller screens, FHD on 43"" will give you a terrible experience especially with this TV that does ZERO anti-aliasing.I cant get past those pixel corners that are so clearly visible. If you don't understand what I am saying, look at the curve of 'M' in Mi when the TV boots up.\nBefore buying this TV i had read many review which mentioned losing WiFi connectivity or apps crashing when streaming full HD content. I myself noticed the same in one of my office TVs and attributed it to poor WiFi strength. But with this TV i can confirm that it is not the WiFi, I have a nighthawk gigabit router sitting less than 5 feet from the TV. When I connect the TV to ethernet, I dont see any more youtube crashes. So the wifi card in the TV is trashy cheap too and unable to handle heavy traffic.\nBoot-up time of the OS is not impressive either and takes ~60 seconds\n\nNow for the good parts.\nInstallation and configuration was super easy. In fact I did it myself in ~15 mins. My grandma looked like she could do it as well.\nThere is a general setting which lets you remember the last used input source. So you can use it an a dumb display with your set-top box or radio frequency TV cable. In my case I found it much more convenient to use my Jio set top box to stream online content in full HD (primevideo, youtube) than using Mi's android tv or patchwall\n\nVerdict\nThe image quality may be forgiven if you pair the TV with good home-theater audio, otherwise this TV is suitable for 1000 rs per night hotel rooms\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610K6tNNRHL._SY88.jpg,3,if you pay peanuts you will get monkey,"\ n you buy cheap and cheap is what you get . no complaints for what i got for the price i paid \ nswitching from a 7 year old sony 21 "" to a mi tv 43 "" , the change in both picture and audio quality is not just noticeable , it is in your face . \ ni mean the audio sounds cheap and tinny . even my jbl bluetooth sounds better . \ nthe image quality is just about suffer-able . also if you are used to 1080p displays like on your phone , laptop , tv with much smaller screens , fhd on 43 "" will give you a terrible experience especially with this tv that does zero anti-aliasing . i cant get past those pixel corners that are so clearly visible . if you do n't understand what i am saying , look at the curve of ' m ' in mi when the tv boots up . \ nbefore buying this tv i had read many review which mentioned losing wifi connectivity or apps crashing when streaming full hd content . i myself noticed the same in one of my office tvs and attributed it to poor wifi strength . but with this tv i can confirm that it is not the wifi , i have a nighthawk gigabit router sitting less than 5 feet from the tv . when i connect the tv to ethernet , i dont see any more youtube crashes . so the wifi card in the tv is trashy cheap too and unable to handle heavy traffic . \ nboot-up time of the os is not impressive either and takes ~ 60 seconds \ n \ nnow for the good parts . \ ninstallation and configuration was super easy . in fact i did it myself in ~ 15 mins . my grandma looked like she could do it as well . \ nthere is a general setting which lets you remember the last used input source . so you can use it an a dumb display with your set-top box or radio frequency tv cable . in my case i found it much more convenient to use my jio set top box to stream online content in full hd ( primevideo , youtube ) than using mi 's android tv or patchwall \ n \ nverdict \ nthe image quality may be forgiven if you pair the tv with good home-theater audio , otherwise this tv is suitable for 1000 rs per night hotel rooms \ n"

I have been using TP Link's Wifi adapter for years so it was a natural choice. Eventually I settled for the C6 as the A6 offered no additional features and C80 and higher had a significantly higher price.\n\nAnyhow this is my initial review, which I will update if anything changes -\n\nBuild - Decent Quality. It's entirely plastic but looks durable. The shiny top surface is a finger magnet but then you won't be handling your router everyday. It is very light and can be balanced on narrow surfaces. Antennas are sturdy and maintain position if the router is moved or shaken quickly.\n\nRating - 5/5\n\nSetup - A bit tricky, this one. I'm on a Static IP FTTH connection so I assumed juet inputing values (IP, Gateway, Subnet, etc) will do the trick. However, it did not. Had to call up customer care and they asked me to change the Primary DNS. From experience I believe there was a MAC lock involved which they unlocked during the call but I can't be sure. Anyway it took about an hour and half to set every thing up. This isn't TP-LINK's fault.\n\nWhat is their fault is that MAC spoofing doesn't seem to work. So if your ISP isn't responding you may be stuck.\n\nRating - 4/5\n\nRange and Signal Strength - Both are miles ahead of my 3C. I have a three storied house with thick 45-year old brick walls. Even on the third storey (with router on the ground floor) I could get a signal. Not possible with my 3c. Of course it's the 2.4GHz one and not 5Ghz but it's there.\n\nSpeed wise 5GHz is the king snd everyone knows that. Within the room and in the next room it works pretty good. Beyond that 2.4GHz seems to work well.\n\nOne grouse I have is that ""Smart"" Connection isn't good. Smart allows your device to connect based on the connection that gets the highest speed in that range. But with Smart on my adapter (from the same brand) gave miserable 560Kbps speeds on a 130Mbps connection. This with the adapter stuck to the computer on which the router was placed.\n\nSeparating the two bands by turning off Smart resulted in a huge improvement. 2.4GHz gives up to 80 Mbps in the same room while 5Ghz gives the full 130Mbps. One floor above I get 30-40Mbps. On the second floor it falls to 10-12Mbps.\n\nSo the antenna and radio are great, but the software needs to be improved.\n\nRating - 4/5\n\nBells and Whistles - The router boasts of MU-MIMO and beam forming. Turning the former on improved my connection speed and stability by around 5-10% on the ground and first floors. Beyond that no noticeable difference could be felt.\n\nHaven't tried other features like VPN etc.\n\nRating - 5/5\n\nConclusion - Compared to the 3C this router actually allows me to enjoy the FTTH speeds I pay for. The hardware is impeccable and sturdy. The software is useful but needs some back end tweaking in the ""Smart"" department. That aside it's one of the most VFM routers under 3K for anyone with a 100Mbps connection or higher.\n\nOverall Rating - 4.5/5\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kRGFiFmvL._SY88.jpg,3,good speeds and sturdy build but needs software improvements,"\ n having burnt my fingers with a single band mi router 3c , i decided to double my budget and go for a decent router from a reputed brand . i have been using tp link 's wifi adapter for years so it was a natural choice . eventually i settled for the c6 as the a6 offered no additional features and c80 and higher had a significantly higher price . \ n \ nanyhow this is my initial review , which i will update if anything changes - \ n \ nbuild - decent quality . it 's entirely plastic but looks durable . the shiny top surface is a finger magnet but then you wo n't be handling your router everyday . it is very light and can be balanced on narrow surfaces . antennas are sturdy and maintain position if the router is moved or shaken quickly . \ n \ nrating - 5/5 \ n \ nsetup - a bit tricky , this one . i 'm on a static ip ftth connection so i assumed juet inputing values ( ip , gateway , subnet , etc ) will do the trick . however , it did not . had to call up customer care and they asked me to change the primary dns . from experience i believe there was a mac lock involved which they unlocked during the call but i can't be sure . anyway it took about an hour and half to set every thing up . this is n't tp-link 's fault . \ n \ nwhat is their fault is that mac spoofing does n't seem to work . so if your isp is n't responding you may be stuck . \ n \ nrating - 4/5 \ n \ nrange and signal strength - both are miles ahead of my 3c . i have a three storied house with thick 45 - year old brick walls . even on the third storey ( with router on the ground floor ) i could get a signal . not possible with my 3c . of course it 's the 2 . 4 ghz one and not 5ghz but it 's there . \ n \ nspeed wise 5ghz is the king snd everyone knows that . within the room and in the next room it works pretty good . beyond that 2 . 4 ghz seems to work well . \ n \ none grouse i have is that "" smart "" connection is n't good . smart allows your device to connect based on the connection that gets the highest speed in that range . but with smart on my adapter ( from the same brand ) gave miserable 560kbps speeds on a 130mbps connection . this with the adapter stuck to the computer on which the router was placed . \ n \ nseparating the two bands by turning off smart resulted in a huge improvement . 2 . 4 ghz gives up to 80 mbps in the same room while 5ghz gives the full 130mbps . one floor above i get 30-40 mbps . on the second floor it falls to 10-12 mbps . \ n \ nso the antenna and radio are great , but the software needs to be improved . \ n \ nrating - 4/5 \ n \ nbells and whistles - the router boasts of mu-mimo and beam forming . turning the former on improved my connection speed and stability by around 5-10 % on the ground and first floors . beyond that no noticeable difference could be felt . \ n \ nhave n't tried other features like vpn etc . \ n \ nrating - 5/5 \ n \ nconclusion - compared to the 3c this router actually allows me to enjoy the ftth speeds i pay for . the hardware is impeccable and sturdy . the software is useful but needs some back end tweaking in the "" smart "" department . that aside it 's one of the most vfm routers under 3k for anyone with a 100mbps connection or higher . \ n \ noverall rating - 4 . 5 / 5 \ n"

Realme is 1inch longer than JBL c100si. But Realme gives 6 months warranty and JBL gives 1 year warranty. Both has mic. But JBL has one control button and Realme has three buttons, one control button and other two to increase or decrease volume. JBL hasn't any rubber band/strap to organise it's cable. Realme cable are braided nylon cord whereas JBL use normal rubber material cable. Though both are tangle free, but Realme is better in terms of cable quality and to manage it's cable than JBL.\n\nNow comparing sound quality, I found JBL far better than Realme. Many YouTube blogger said that Realme sound is best in ₹600 -700 price range earphone segment because of it's 11mm driver. They gave better position to Realme than JBL. Though Realme has 11mm driver, but it's sound is noisy. JBL sound quality is smoother than Realme. Bass and treble everything is clear and the sound doesn't disturb your ear. I can say it sounds like Sony music system. You will surely love to listen music with JBL c100si earphone.\n\nIn terms of fitting, both are good. But JBL has little bit edge over Realme because of it's shape. And Realme is slightly heavier than JBL.\n\nRegarding call quality, I didn't find any difference in call quality in either of these earphones. The sound is clear in both ends.\n\nHope this review will give you a clear idea to choose the right one...👍\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BGG6j-y6L._SY88.jpg,3,comparison of jbl c100si with realme bud 2 :,"\ n today i would like to compare it with realme bud 2 . \ n \ nin terms of build quality realme slightly better . realme is 1inch longer than jbl c100si . but realme gives 6 months warranty and jbl gives 1 year warranty . both has mic . but jbl has one control button and realme has three buttons , one control button and other two to increase or decrease volume . jbl has n't any rubber band / strap to organise it 's cable . realme cable are braided nylon cord whereas jbl use normal rubber material cable . though both are tangle free , but realme is better in terms of cable quality and to manage it 's cable than jbl . \ n \ nnow comparing sound quality , i found jbl far better than realme . many youtube blogger said that realme sound is best in ₹ 600 - 700 price range earphone segment because of it 's 11mm driver . they gave better position to realme than jbl . though realme has 11mm driver , but it 's sound is noisy . jbl sound quality is smoother than realme . bass and treble everything is clear and the sound does n't disturb your ear . i can say it sounds like sony music system . you will surely love to listen music with jbl c100si earphone . \ n \ nin terms of fitting , both are good . but jbl has little bit edge over realme because of it 's shape . and realme is slightly heavier than jbl . \ n \ nregarding call quality , i did n't find any difference in call quality in either of these earphones . the sound is clear in both ends . \ n \ nhope this review will give you a clear idea to choose the right one . . . :thumbs_up: \ n"

It's now re-energized.\n\nMine is old Intel Pentium based laptop with 4GB DDR3 RAM (HP Compaq 15-s103TU), that supports only SATA2 (3Gbps) interface. I knew that SSDs perform best with SATA3 (6 Gbps) interface. Still gave it a try. Voila!! I am pleasantly surprised.\n\nI cloned my HDD boot partition (with Win7 64bit) on SSD and there is significant improvement in booting times, application launch timings and even page load timings on Chrome.\n\nI am planning clean re-install of OS during christmas break, and that should further improve performance.\n\nthis upgrade is so impressive, that I cancelled planned RAM upgrade to 8GB (for now).\n\nImportant :\nfirst I tried clone HDD boot partition (C:) on SSD using ""Acronis True Image for Crucial"" (downloaded from Crucial website). but I couldn't find direct method to just clone one partition.

Awesome machine for capturing memorable moments - specially who are beginners and are planning to buy a new camera to start but getting confused - I would not say much - just look at the shots that I took and uploaded here from my camera and you yourself will come to know what I am trying to say as there is a saying ""A Pictures Speaks Thousand of Words"" (Please note- all of these uploaded pictures have taken from its kit lenses itself - I didn't use any prime lens for these blurry effects).\n\n2. I don't want to go deeper into the technicality here - I would simply recommend all to buy this camera if you are specially looking to have your Camera for general photography purpose - not for commercial use.

So far so good !! Heavy Duty Battery. Top specs at a reasonable price.,"\n I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.\nThis phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.\n\nNow coming to the phone :\n\nPros :-\n1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.\n2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.\n3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.\n4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.\n5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.\n6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.\nOther conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nNow coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :\n1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.\n2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.\n3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.\n\nOverall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718ik5N9YzL._SY88.jpg,3,awesome buy ! ! so far so good ! ! heavy duty battery . top specs at a reasonable price .,"\ n i used to be a samsung customer long back but had switched to chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now . it is very refreshing to see samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20 k segment . \ nthis phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of samsung in this price bracket . \ n \ nnow coming to the phone :\ n \ npros :-\ n1 . battery : this has to be the single largest plus point of this phone . at 6000mah , its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge . on the other hand , this battery easily lasts 1 . 5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage . \ n2 . dedicated memory slot ( 2 + 1 ) : this is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card . \ n3 . screen quality - it is fhd + screen with nice and smooth colors . there is no lag and it feels fluidic . where it scores over other brands is that samsung offers super amoled screen whereas other brands have lcd capacitive touch screen . though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one . \ n4 . camera - again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm . also , there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution . front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp . no lag in clicking front photos as well . \ n5 . size : it is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand . \ n6 . memory : 6gb ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient . plus , the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on . \ nother conviniences include - type c charging port and fast charging support and 3 . 5 mm audio jack . \ n \ nnow coming to the cons . not many but a couple i definitely noticed :\ n1 . fingerprint sensor : it is not just bad but very bad ( and i mean it ) . very unresponsive and erratic . i mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger . and it may sometimes glitch as well . so , you need to retry . \ n2 . charging cable : extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless . length is very insufficient . \ n3 . charger : it is a standard 5v - 2a charger . they could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging . \ n \ noverall if you take a look at the price ( 15k ) , it is an awesome buy . apart from the fingerprint sensor , i found everything in the phone to be top-notch . the specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer . would definitely recommend this anytime :) \ n"

Wide angle is usable but not the best. I never used macro and depth.\nSecondary camera is also good at this price. Note : I disable beauty modes etc, those just make your face look weird.\nAttached a same photo in regular mode, not 64 ( blacked out serial number intentionally 😃 ). I'm sure that image will compress when uploading but believe me it's good.\n\nAudio call and network quality is good. No Bluetooth or wifi issues. Dolby Atmos is good to change the equalizer to your taste.\n\nDisplay has awesome contrast and colors and you can change settings for it.\nPlease do buy a case, the back plastic is a fingerprint magnet. Also you don't want to drop test the beautiful screen. Build quality good, but it is not that great when compared to Nokia or Samsung S or A series.\n\nComing from stock android the OneUI is good, it takes some time getting used to it. Miss the haptic feedback on keyboard. Do opt out of the marketing stuff in the initial setup to get the best experience.

But it does not matter since this is not a modem, but a router. It works perfectly when plugged into the lan port of your existing router/modem.\n2. The range for 5GHz is not terrible. It is much lower than that of 2.4GHz but that is to be expected.\n3. Speed on 5GHz throughout my double storey house does not drop beyond 50 Mbps. So, I've disabled the 2.4 band.\n\nI have this router plugged into my ZTE Router/Modem that was provided to me by my ISP (Connect Broadband, Punjab). The modem has a GE port. Make sure that whatever you plug this into has a GE port. GE stands for Gigabit Ethernet. Without GE on your modem, this will be a waste of money for you.\n\nLast point, make sure that you're using at least a Cat5E cable for the connection. The one supplied in the box is also 5E, but if you can get 6 that would be perfect.\n\n5E can only supply speeds upto 100 Mbps in theory.\n\nHope you found this review helpful!\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81L7LVSSZ9L._SY88.jpg,3,a value for money and perfect product .,"\ n a wonderful product that does justice to my 100 mbps connection . i am not gonna into a detailed review , but i would like to highlight some points that were raised by some other reviewers . \ n1 . it is ver 2 of the hardware , and yes , it 's designed to be sold in the us . but it does not matter since this is not a modem , but a router . it works perfectly when plugged into the lan port of your existing router / modem . \ n2 . the range for 5ghz is not terrible . it is much lower than that of 2 . 4 ghz but that is to be expected . \ n3 . speed on 5ghz throughout my double storey house does not drop beyond 50 mbps . so , i 've disabled the 2 . 4 band . \ n \ ni have this router plugged into my zte router / modem that was provided to me by my isp ( connect broadband , punjab ) . the modem has a ge port . make sure that whatever you plug this into has a ge port . ge stands for gigabit ethernet . without ge on your modem , this will be a waste of money for you . \ n \ nlast point , make sure that you 're using at least a cat 5e cable for the connection . the one supplied in the box is also 5e , but if you can get 6 that would be perfect . \ n \ n5e can only supply speeds upto 100 mbps in theory . \ n \ nhope you found this review helpful ! \ n"

It will boost your soul and spirits, fill your heart with longing and happiness &amp; will take you back to the time when life was simpler and fun.\n\nIt is a collection of 22 short stories told by Ajji to her grandchildren Raghu, Meenu,Anand, Krishna and their neighbourhood friends. The grandchildren come to their grandparents place during their summer vacations. Their grandparents house is away from the hustle-bustle of the city life; surrounded by greenery and open field. The children however are most excited about the stories that Ajji is going to tell them during their stay with her.\n\nThe stories told by the grandmother are short &amp; sweet moral stories. These stories deal on wide variety of topics such as importance of:\n📍 hard work &amp;honesty\n📍being down to earth, being helpful &amp; humble &amp; content &amp; loyal\n📍having presence of mind\n📍loving people unconditionally\nAll the stories will fill you up with hope and that feeling of content that you used to feel if your grandparents also told you stories.\n\nThe narration is very effective as you will be able to retain the stories for a long time. The tone is full of warmth. The book is woven in a way to make you feel nostalgic.The book brought back strong memories of my childhood when my brother &amp; me used to travel to my native place with our parents to meet our grandparents during summer &amp; winter breaks. Those memories were overwhelming. The smile that used to break on my Amma's &amp; Dadaji's face are images that I would cherish for my lifetime. It's a shame that I lost them so early.\n\n This was my first Sudha Murty book &amp; I am so glad that I picked up her book. It brought me out of my reading slump of 2 long months.

Waste of money and time! 😑,"\n Edit: The third pic shows you what I had to go through, to get the phone repaired from Samsung service centre!! No social distancing, and many were not wearing masks properly! Read on...\n\nI wondered how Samsung is able to sell these mobiles (M series) at such an affordable prices competing with Mi, Oppo, and Vivo! Now I know the secret, it is done by lowering the “quality”! The M31 I bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months! It started as a small blue “dot” at the left corner and grown to an “inch wide” blue patch on the screen! Boom, within a week, you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across. See the images.\n\nWhen we visited the Samsung service centre, traveling for about 80kms, the reception was extremely poor and rude! The person standing at the store entrance said “this is not covered under warranty” without even having a technician checking what is the problem! Basically looks like they are all trained to say that line. When we insisted to check what is the problem, the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin (apparently it is a very minor one, that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses), that we never understood. Another thing I noticed is, most of the people at the service centre are with their “Samsung M series” mobiles in hand, which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them!!\n\nWe had to give the phone for display replacement, that costed us another ~6K on top of the 17K we spent for this! I could have bought Oneplus Nord by spending another 5K on top!! Waste of money and time 😑😑😑\n\nIt’s a clear no to buy Samsung M Series!!!\n",1,disgust,0,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7iq5FE9L._SY88.jpg,1,a big noo for samsung m series ! ! ! waste of money and time ! :expressionless_face:,"\ n edit : the third pic shows you what i had to go through , to get the phone repaired from samsung service centre ! ! no social distancing , and many were not wearing masks properly ! read on . . . \ n \ ni wondered how samsung is able to sell these mobiles ( m series ) at such an affordable prices competing with mi , oppo , and vivo ! now i know the secret , it is done by lowering the “ quality ” ! the m31 i bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months ! it started as a small blue “ dot ” at the left corner and grown to an “ inch wide ” blue patch on the screen ! boom , within a week , you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across . see the images . \ n \ nwhen we visited the samsung service centre , traveling for about 80kms , the reception was extremely poor and rude ! the person standing at the store entrance said “ this is not covered under warranty ” without even having a technician checking what is the problem ! basically looks like they are all trained to say that line . when we insisted to check what is the problem , the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin ( apparently it is a very minor one , that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses ) , that we never understood . another thing i noticed is , most of the people at the service centre are with their “ samsung m series ” mobiles in hand , which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them ! ! \ n \ nwe had to give the phone for display replacement , that costed us another ~ 6k on top of the 17k we spent for this ! i could have bought oneplus nord by spending another 5k on top ! ! waste of money and time :expressionless_face: :expressionless_face: :expressionless_face: \ n \ nit 's a clear no to buy samsung m series ! ! ! \ n"

Thought of upgrade my laptop itself and realized that I have to spent 60K for the latest one. So decided to give chance for my old laptop by upgrading it's RAM and HDD.\n\nSince it's an old laptop it doesn't have a m.2 or nvme SSD slot in its board. So bought this 2.5"" SSD which will perfectly fit in my 2.5"" inch SATA HDD slot. I was in doubt when I bought this whether it will work or not. Trust me this thing worked like a charm.!!! Now my laptop is superfast (as compared to my old HDD) and windows 10 boots up in few seconds. And also launching apps accessing huge files became much much faster. Now I feel like it's a new laptop.!!!\n\nOnly problem was how to clone my old HDD and OS without loosing license and data. But crucial site has all the support you need. They have step by step videos to install and upgrade your old laptop. I am not a laptop mechanic, still am able to replace my HDD myself (see the pics). They have cloning software which is free for us(there are third-party sw which does the cloning but we have to pay). Very easy to upgrade by following those docs/videos.\n\nExtremely happy for this purchase.
