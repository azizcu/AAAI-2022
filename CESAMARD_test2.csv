This is a Decent phone at this price. Most of the time the Fingerprint reader unable to unlock the phone. This type of camera quality isn't expected from 64MP, f1.8 camera sensor. Macro camera, selfie camera, wide angle camera okay. In this phone, you can't choose ringtone from external memory or even phone memory and Samsung should give the internet speed notification, daily usage on the notification bar like other mobile phone to compete in this type of small matter, without giving that Glance, Discover etc option. Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone.

After graduating from law school in 1980, he practiced for a few years. Feeling unhappy with his career in law, he became a motivational speaker which he felt was his true calling. The numerous examples of people who achieved their goals through positive attitude are from his personal experience and research\n\nWhat do I like about this book?\n- The overall motivational tone of the book, that creates a positive drive within yourself\n- To-the-point crisp writing, without being verbose at all (unlike some other books which keep reiterating the same points through multiple pages)\n- Powerful examples from history\n- Great quotes by famous men. It is just a treat to read all these famous words by eminent people.\n- The book justifies its title ‘Attitude is everything’ through its content.\n\nWhat I did not like about the book?\nWell, honestly, NOTHING. I’m usually critical of books if I find any flaws with the writing, or content, or engagement, but I didn’t find anything lacking in this one. Hence, the complete five stars. The book is beautifully written with meaningful content.\n\nThe book begins with a famous quote by Thomas Jefferson – “Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.” In the first chapter, Jeff Keller talks about his own circumstances that led to his career change, finally becoming a motivational speaker. He mentions general problems faced by common people in their day to day lives and hence creates a bond with the reader.\n\nThe book is primarily divided into 3 parts and 12 lessons. Each part includes various lessons, which are thought-provoking. The basic message conveyed through these three parts and lessons is – “When you THINK, SPEAK, and ACT in ways that support your success, you’re firing on all cylinders and on the way to achieving phenomenal results in your life.”\n\nPART 1 – SUCCESS BEGINS IN THE MIND: THINKING\nIn this part, the author tries to teach us that success begins in the mind, and he focuses on the power of attitude and belief in shaping your destiny.\n\nLesson 1 – Your Attitude is your window to the world.\nAttitude is like a mental filter through which you experience the world around you. Some people see the world through a filter of optimism while others have a more pessimist outlook. A person with positive attitude thinks ‘I CAN’ while the others think ‘I CAN’T’. We all start off with a clean window when we are young, and as we grow old, life throws some dirt on the window (like criticism, ridicule from peers, rejections, disappointments), and we start doubting our capabilities, we start having negative outlook towards thinks, and we are not as confident as we used to be earlier. The advice given in the lesson is to wash our mental window, so we can control our mental attitude. Every human being has the power to choose his attitude. Every human being has the power to choose his/her reactions to different things happening all around.\nOne of the many Examples cited – Dr. Viktor Frankl’s (Author of Man’s Search for Meaning – would recommend people to read this) experiences during concentration camp.\n\nLesson 2 – You are a human magnet.\nThe message of this lesson can be summed up in a single quote by Earl Nightingale – “We become what we think about.” Jeff states the idea of ‘dominant thought’. He says, your dominant thoughts rule the day. Your beliefs brought you to where you are today, and your thinking from this point forward will take you where you will be in the future. As human magnets, we have the power to attract success through our thoughts. If you think about positive things, positive outcomes, success – same shall follow. However, he rightly warns against the expectation of overnight success too.\n\nLesson 3 – Picture your way to success.\nThe author asks the readers to create mental movies in the mind, picturing things and milestones they wished to achieve. At the same time, we have to get rid of our old rubbish mental images, which remind us of failure, negativity, and disappointments.\nOne of the many Examples cited – Story of singer Celine Dion where she mentions that from the age of five, she had always imagined singing in front of houseful audience, receiving multiple awards and becoming a superstar. Another example quoted is of Jim Carrey, who wrote a post-dated cheque to himself for $10 Million, which acted as a source of inspiration for him.\n\nLesson 4 - Make A Commitment And You Will Move Mountains.\nJeff mentions the book ‘The ultimate secret to getting absolutely everything you want’ by Mike Hemaki. He says, the key to getting what you want is the ‘willingness to do whatever it takes’ to accomplish your goals. When you commit to something, positive events start happening, the whole universe conspires to make it happen.\nHe gives the example of Benjamin Roll who cleared the bar council exam in his 14th attempt at the age of 74! Another example cited is that of ‘Baldacci’ who became a writer, by learning the craft of writing, through sheer commitment.\n\nLesson 5 - Turn Your Problems Into Opportunities.\nWhenever something goes wrong, we start questioning ourselves, our circumstances and at times our luck. In such a situation, we have two choices – 1. Keep feeling miserable or 2. Learn a lesson from the problem and move on. A problem should be seen as an opportunity to learn, improve, and do something better next time. Adversity encourages us to make necessary changes in our life, tap our hidden potential. It teaches us to be grateful for the small things and helps us build self-esteem and confidence.\nAs Napolean said, “Every adversity carries with it the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.”\n\nPART 2 – WATCH YOUR WORDS: SPEAKING\nIn this part, the author focuses on what we speak. What we say, directly shows how we think, and precedes our actions.\n\nLesson 6 – Your Worlds Blaze A Trails.\nThe author says that words have immense power. They can build your future, destroy opportunities or help maintain the status quo. Your choice of words defines your personality.\nAlways remember – Thoughts &gt; Words &gt; Beliefs &gt; Actions &gt; Results\nThe author cites an inspirational example of Kent Cullers, a scientist at NASA.\n\nLesson 7 – How are you?\nJeff says that this question is the most frequently asked questions to any person, and what reply a person gives to this question is extremely important. Now, a reply to this question can be – Positive, Mediocre or Negative. We should avoid negative answers as they drain the energy of others as well. Jeff says that we should always reply to this question with words such as ‘Terrific’ or ‘Great’ or other such positive words. This will help boost our confidence and create a positive outlook.\n\nLesson 8 – Stop complaining.\nNobody wants to hear about our pains and problems. As William Penn said, “the secret of happiness is to count your blessings while others are adding up their troubles.” Jeff says that complaining is a major problem in all of us, whereas it doesn’t help anyone. It doesn’t help the person ranting about his problems, and definitely doesn’t help the listener who’s least interested in listening to someone else’s problems when he has plenty of his own. However, at the same time, the author clarifies that sharing your problems with your nearest ones, is different from complaining, and rightly so.\n\nPART 3 – HEAVEN HELPS THOSE WHO ACT: ACTION\nIn this part, the author emphasizes on the fact that without action, positive thoughts and words will not help you attain the level of success you aimed for.\n\nLesson 9 - Associate with Positive People.\nWe are the average of the people we spend our most time with. The people you hang out with define your outlook and future because they greatly influence our thoughts and life. Hence, it is very important to be in the company of positive people, who have definite goals for themselves. Hanging around folks with no ambition or goals, who imbibe negativity in you, will put you on the path of failure.\n\nLesson 10 - Confront Your Fears and Grow.\nThe path that leads to success is often filled with obstacles. The people who succeed, do so by overcoming these obstacles. If you want to achieve something, you have to get out of your ‘comfort zone’. You have to stretch yourself. Adopt a mindset that helps you acquire what you want. Remember, repetition is the key, like any other muscle. It will build up and encourage you to do something great.\n\nLesson 11 – Get out there and fail.\nWinston Churchill said, - “Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” In order to success someday, you must be willing to fail today. Successful people around the world are wise enough to know that success doesn’t come in one shot. You have pe persevere, fail again and again, learn from your failures, and work on it again with double enthusiasm.\nThe author cites an example of TV talk show host ‘Sally Jessy Raphael’, who was fired 18 times, couldn’t pay her credit card bills for 26 years, lived on food stamps, before finally making it big in the industry.\n\nLesson 12 - Networking That Gets Results.\nThis lesson shows the importance of teamwork. It shows, if you’re positive and ready to help people, people, in turn, will go out of their way to help you back. Some key points from this lesson –\n- Develop a win-win attitude.\n- Effectively participate in a group or organization.\n- Do not stop the flow of messages, you should keep in touch with your peers.\n- Become a good listener.\n- Congratulate people on for their accomplishment.\n- Make new friends in your field.\n- Do more for others, before expecting something in return.\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the best self-improvement books ever written. The content of this book far outweighs its price, and although I have provided the summary for a quick glance, you can still go ahead and pick the book for a quick read. There are many more powerful impactful examples cited throughout the book which make this one an interesting read. Recommended!\n\nFavorite Quotes from the book:\n- “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way…. Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food, and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis, it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not the result of camp influences alone.”\n- “When you believe you can do something, you have the courage to move forward despite being afraid.”\n- “As adults, most of us become a lot more concerned about the opinions of others, often hesitating because people may laugh at us or criticize us. At the age of six, we knew we had to fall.”\n- “Whether you think you can—or think you can’t—you’re right!” – Henry Ford\n- “You see, when you change your attitude, sparks fly in the universe. You’re energized. You begin to see new possibilities. You move into action. You achieve extraordinary results. That’s why I say when you change your attitude, you change your life!”\n- “What the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.”\n- “They can because they think they can.” – Virgil\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/419M80WE6QL._SY88.jpg,3,read this summary review and save your money,"\ n this book is written by jeff keller who is a motivational speaker , which is evident through the motivational tone of the book . after graduating from law school in 1980 , he practiced for a few years . feeling unhappy with his career in law , he became a motivational speaker which he felt was his true calling . the numerous examples of people who achieved their goals through positive attitude are from his personal experience and research \ n \ nwhat do i like about this book ? \ n -

Given its compact size, it makes it convenient to carry anywhere you want\n-Cable/wire is extraordinarily long (6 meters). However, that's a great plus point. The long wire makes recording much easier and hassle-free\n-It has a Velcro for cable management. So, not a difficult task to keep the lengthy wire under control.\n-It weighs around 100gms\n-There are no batteries included\n-There's a switch ON/OFF button. While recording You need to switch to CAMERA MODE (Don't really know why its written camera)\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n-My recordings have improved considerably with this Mic and I am loving it.\n-Just one complaint I have. It captures a lot of airflow meaning I can hear a lot of air from my mouth in the final output. Even If I record anything while holding the mic from a considerable distance I can hear my breathing sounds.\n-Sound quality is loud enough and crisp.\n-It does capture my room's ceiling fan sound. So, I can hear that-- whoosh-- sound in the background when I am plugged into my earphones.\n-I record with the AC on and keep the fan switched off.\n\nAlso, It comes with a handy pouch to keep your mic safe (yay).\nSo, finally Best for production for a beginner like me because at this price it gives ample quality output.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715LNEAztIL._SY88.jpg,3,best budget buy-boya mic,"\ n hi , \ nso , after using this mic for about a month i am writing this review . \ ni will give the most genuine review of this mic . \ nso , let 's begin . what does a beginner need ? \ na budget-friendly mic yet gives the best output . right ? \ n \ nbuilt quality \ n-mic piece is very compact and handy to use . given its compact size , it makes it convenient to carry anywhere you want \ n-cable / wire is extraordinarily long ( 6 meters ) . however , that 's a great plus point . the long wire makes recording much easier and hassle-free \ n-it has a velcro for cable management . so , not a difficult task to keep the lengthy wire under control . \ n-it weighs around 100gms \ n-there are no batteries included \ n-there 's a switch on / off button . while recording you need to switch to camera mode ( do n't really know why its written camera ) \ n \ nsound quality \ n-my recordings have improved considerably with this mic and i am loving it . \ n-just one complaint i have . it captures a lot of airflow meaning i can hear a lot of air from my mouth in the final output . even if i record anything while holding the mic from a considerable distance i can hear my breathing sounds . \ n-sound quality is loud enough and crisp . \ n-it does capture my room 's ceiling fan sound . so , i can hear that - - whoosh - - sound in the background when i am plugged into my earphones . \ n-i record with the ac on and keep the fan switched off . \ n \ nalso , it comes with a handy pouch to keep your mic safe ( yay ) . \ nso , finally best for production for a beginner like me because at this price it gives ample quality output . \ n",3145.jpg

The binding of pages is not good. For the product I would give 2-3 out of 5. But as the heading suggests it's a book review\n\nLet's start with a fun fact. Do you know this book was published in 1999 when the world was worrying about the Y2K apocalypse, Jeff Keller wrote this gem of a book before entering the modern era of crazy 20th Century.\nAttitude is something which is never ever thought in books, it is something which an individual learns and adapts from his/her surroundings. Starting from family, teachers and friends, each and everyone in your life will influence and unknowingly manipulate your thoughts. What the author is trying to say in the book over a course of 12 well crafted chapters is that one has always control of his/her attitude so why not channelize the enter focus of attitude towards positivity and self belief so that we are able to perform to the maximum potential. What I loved about the book was the fact that there were these deep meaningful proverbs and motivational lines written throughout the book quoting famous people so that you read them and feel energized and motivated with same. The author is not afraid to share his story stating how painfully miserable and depressed he was working as a full time lawyer. Something most of us are going through in this state of life wondering is it worth to slog into the office just to realize that in the end it was certainly not worth it. The author has written the book in the most simplest of language and explained some beautiful concepts to change one's attitude from a pessimist to an optimist. Something I will try to implement personally in my life. All in all I would not write anything from the book and potray that I am englightened and changed after reading this book.\n\nWhat I would say is that, if you are exhausted from daily routine, just take a break from netflix, YouTube, hotstar and what not and read this book. It can do wonders for you and might change your life for good.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EGCgcw1QL._SY88.jpg,3,book review . .,"\ n amazon delivery bang on . the binding of pages is not good . for the product i would give 2-3 out of 5 . but as the heading suggests it 's a book review \ n \ nlet 's start with a fun fact . do you know this book was published in 1999 when the world was worrying about the y2k apocalypse , jeff keller wrote this gem of a book before entering the modern era of crazy 20th century . \ nattitude is something which is never ever thought in books , it is something which an individual learns and adapts from his / her surroundings . starting from family , teachers and friends , each and everyone in your life will influence and unknowingly manipulate your thoughts . what the author is trying to say in the book over a course of 12 well crafted chapters is that one has always control of his / her attitude so why not channelize the enter focus of attitude towards positivity and self belief so that we are able to perform to the maximum potential . what i loved about the book was the fact that there were these deep meaningful proverbs and motivational lines written throughout the book quoting famous people so that you read them and feel energized and motivated with same . the author is not afraid to share his story stating how painfully miserable and depressed he was working as a full time lawyer . something most of us are going through in this state of life wondering is it worth to slog into the office just to realize that in the end it was certainly not worth it . the author has written the book in the most simplest of language and explained some beautiful concepts to change one 's attitude from a pessimist to an optimist . something i will try to implement personally in my life . all in all i would not write anything from the book and potray that i am englightened and changed after reading this book . \ n \ nwhat i would say is that , if you are exhausted from daily routine , just take a break from netflix , youtube , hotstar and what not and read this book . it can do wonders for you and might change your life for good . \ n",36.jpg

Just GO FOR IT.,"\n Bought the M31 around 2 weeks back. Extremely satisfied with the perfomance.\n Battery life is amazing, getting more than 1 full day with extra-heavy usage (usually my phones last half a day on a heavy use day). With moderate usage, it can go up to 2 days on a full charge. Video edits, image edits, hours on Facebook and whatsapp, around 2 hours of calling per day. Camera is outstanding with sunlight and in medium light conditions. In very low light, the camera is average, but definitely not bad. Macro shots are amazing. 64mp option for images create crystal clear images of upto 20-25 mb size!!. There has been no lag whatsoever with multiple heavy app usage yet. Fingerprint reader is superfast and has taken more than one try to unlock only a couple of times so far, that too when my finger was moist.

I'll be very quick to support my claims:\n\n1) Camera :- I do not find the rear camera to be 64MP, nor the front to be 32MP. Image quality is not appreciable, given the images shown in commercials. Wide angle images seem to be a little distorted/stretched from the edges.\n\n2) Battery: I don't find the phone's battery 'up to the mark'. That cinder block battery takes around 2 hours to charge from 15% to mere 65%. So. that's annoying especially when fast charging is being advertised everywhere. Also, if you use this phone just like any normal phone, you'll end with around 20% at 8-9 pm. I guess, this tower-sized battery has been given just to support this big device. Nothing more nothing less. No doubt, it's not a 'monster!'.\n\n3) Size:- Gone are those days when you could find a phone within this price change that actually fits in your pocket! I mean literally! The phone is big for hands as well as the pockets. After a few days, you'll find it more of like an annoying piece of plastic ruining your day to day activities.\n\n4)Speaker:- The speaker (main) of this device again falls behind mark. If you are used to watching movies/shows on this big screen of phones, the speaker falls behind miserably. The sound is not even loud or crystal clear.\n\n5) Authenticity issues:- With just two thin stickers joining the two boxes, this is perhaps the biggest issue.\n\n6) Weak sensors: The portrait to landscape mode shift takes 5 to 10 seconds!!!\nAll in all, the phone was not at par with the price paid. The only thing I loved was the screen refresh rate.\nSo, it's a NO-GO for me.\n",1,sadness,0,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lJGWN6DNL._SY88.jpg,4,quite average phone at highly overpriced rate ! !,"\ n i am really not satisfied with this samsung m31 . i 'll be very quick to support my claims :\ n \ n1 ) camera : - i do not find the rear camera to be 64mp , nor the front to be 32mp . image quality is not appreciable , given the images shown in commercials . wide angle images seem to be a little distorted / stretched from the edges . \ n \ n2 ) battery : i do n't find the phone 's battery ' up to the mark ' . that cinder block battery takes around 2 hours to charge from 15 % to mere 65 % . so . that 's annoying especially when fast charging is being advertised everywhere . also , if you use this phone just like any normal phone , you 'll end with around 20 % at 8-9 pm . i guess , this tower-sized battery has been given just to support this big device . nothing more nothing less . no doubt , it 's not a ' monster !

MiBand crusher.","\n &nbsp;Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself. I wanted to get an Apple Watch for my wife as I was impressed by the design but fortunately I found this Noise ColorFit Pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the Apple watch. Bought this one for Rs.2999.\n\n----------------------\n?? IN THE BOX\n----------------------\n? The smart watch module with screen protector applied\n? 22mm wide TPU strap\n? Charging cable\n? Instruction Manual and Warranty Registration card\n\n--------------------\n? FEATURES\n--------------------\n? 1.3 inch 240x240 capacitive display\n? Curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating,\n? IP68 Full dustproof and waterproof\n? 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage, 45 days standby\n? Bluetooth 5.0 BLE\n? 24/7 heart Rate sensor, sedentary alarm, breathe feature, and usual health and sleep monitoring.\n? App, message, social media and call notifications.\n? Music control\n? Menstrual cycle tracking\n? 9 sports mode - Walk, Yoga, Spin, Run, Climb, Workout, Bike, Hike, Treadmill.\n\n---------------------\n??? MY USAGE\n---------------------\n? At just 35g weight and 22mm TPU band makes this band the very comfortable to wear. Also the strap is skin friendly and I didn’t get allergy with sweat on this band.\n? The straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type.\n? The charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything. I felt this type of charging the easiest of all.\n? The looks is very premium, though is made up of polycarbonate, the grey and black colors, the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an Apple Watch.\n? There are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the Apple watch face design. As of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited, I hope customizations will be made available.\n? The display is beautiful and under direct sunlight I found the watch display visible, though not the best visibility but to a certain extent.\n? There is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button. I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.\n? The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).\n? Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.\n? The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.\n? I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.\n? There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.\n\n-------------------------\n?? WHAT I LIKED\n-------------------------\n? The premium design and great display. Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.\n? Battery life of 7 to 10 days.\n? IPX68 dust and waterproof.\n? Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring\n? Better control &amp; display of calls, messages and music from the band\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n?? WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED\n-------------------------------------------------\n? More exercise or activities could have been included like Badminton etc.\n? Only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year.\n\n-------------------\n?? OVERALL\n-------------------\nThe MiBand 4 is definitely feature rich and Noise ColorFit Pro 2 has similar or a bit more features, I found this one much better in areas like build, design, charging. I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. ??\n",1,surprise,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-WEwjw55L._SY88.jpg,5,"4 . 5 ? awesome design , good specs and features . miband crusher .","\ n most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself . i wanted to get an apple watch for my wife as i was impressed by the design but fortunately i found this noise colorfit pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the apple watch . bought this one for rs . 2999 . \ n \ n - - - \ n ? ? in the box \ n - - - \ n ? the smart watch module with screen protector applied \ n ? 22mm wide tpu strap \ n ? charging cable \ n ? instruction manual and warranty registration card \ n \ n - - - \ n ? features \ n - - - \ n ? 1 . 3 inch 240x240 capacitive display \ n ? curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating , \ n ? ip68 full dustproof and waterproof \ n ? 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage , 45 days standby \ n ? bluetooth 5 . 0 ble \ n ? 24/7 heart rate sensor , sedentary alarm , breathe feature , and usual health and sleep monitoring . \ n ? app , message , social media and call notifications . \ n ? music control \ n ? menstrual cycle tracking \ n ? 9 sports mode - walk , yoga , spin , run , climb , workout , bike , hike , treadmill . \ n \ n - - - \ n ? ? ? my usage \ n - - - \ n ? at just 35g weight and 22mm tpu band makes this band the very comfortable to wear . also the strap is skin friendly and i did n't get allergy with sweat on this band . \ n ? the straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type . \ n ? the charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything . i felt this type of charging the easiest of all . \ n ? the looks is very premium , though is made up of polycarbonate , the grey and black colors , the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an apple watch . \ n ? there are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the apple watch face design . as of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited , i hope customizations will be made available . \ n ? the display is beautiful and under direct sunlight i found the watch display visible , though not the best visibility but to a certain extent . \ n ? there is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button . i found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button . \ n ? the ip68 certification means now i i do n't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth ( ip_8 ) and also no need to worry about dirt ( ip6_ ) . \ n ? health , fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion , and surprisingly the noisefit sport app is also good . the breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe . i found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off , it takes to almost 10 days . \ n ? the sleep , heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion . most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available . \ n ? i can now read messages and notification from the band easily . from the app i was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations . \ n ? there are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone , turn off / on continuous heart rate monitoring , do not disturb , wrist . the female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion . \ n \ n - - - \ n ? ? what i liked \ n - - - \ n ? the premium design and great display . much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion . \ n ? battery life of 7 to 10 days . \ n ? ipx 68 dust and waterproof . \ n ? pretty accurate fitness , health and sleep monitoring \ n ? better control & display of calls , messages and music from the band \ n \ n - - - \ n ? ? what i felt can be improved \ n - - - \ n ? more exercise or activities could have been included like badminton etc . \ n ? only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year . \ n \ n - - - \ n ? ? overall \ n - - - \ nthe miband 4 is definitely feature rich and noise colorfit pro 2 has similar or a bit more features , i found this one much better in areas like build , design , charging . i do n't have a honor band so i can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best . ? ? \ n",1885.jpg

Problems recurred after a week.\n\nMy diagnosis: Ageing disk, probably with few bad sectors that Apple formatting APFS was tripping over. Decided to change internal HDD to SSD, and add more RAM.\n\nSamsung 860EVO 500GB seemed the best, affordable choice. Would have preferred the ‘blade’ NVMe 970 Pro, but it is more than double the price; more importantly, it’s incompatible with the iMac’s pin and channel configuration.\n\nSo, I picked the Samsung 860 EVO and&nbsp;\n; \n &nbsp;for my upgrade.\n\nUpgrading the internal drive of a slim-profile (5mm) iMac is not easy. Even in experienced hands, there is a very high risk of damaging the LED display panel, which has to be sliced off the aluminium chassis (see iFixit’s tutorial). Even more dangerous is remounting the display panel, as the quality and strength of the tapes sold online are highly suspect, with many users reporting that their displays fell off and smashed after remounting with such tapes.\n\nThe OEM adhesive strip used by Apple is a custom 3M VHB tape (5mm wide, 1 mm thick). So I spoke with 3M India, and after keeping me dangling in hope for 3 weeks, they stopped taking my calls. Thanks 3M. :(\n\nThe workaround was to shop around with Apple Authorised Resellers / Service. None of them would sell me the mounting tape separately, but they would do my disk upgrade for a price ranging from ₹4800 to ₹2500 (tape + service). Seemed the better option, as it mitigated the risk of damaging the display panel and ruining my Mac.\n\nPreparation:\n• Installed the Crucial RAM myself (8GB x 2 slots).\n• Cloned my existing hard drive to the Samsung SSD 860 EVO, and ran it externally as the boot drive to check things out, for about a week.\n• Took my Mac and new, data-loaded and bootable SSD to an Apple Authorised Service Center, on the appointed date.\n\n2 hours later, my upgrade was done.\n\nI did not buy or use a 3.5 to 2.5” drive adapter; double-sided tape is sufficient to mount the SSD inside the iMac’s chassis (technicians concurred). Neither does the SSD require an external ‘thermal sensor’; it runs cool.\n\nPost upgrade:\n1. The first thing to do after the SSD is the internal boot drive is to startup normally, and do a full Time Machine backup.\n2. Once done, ENABLE TRIM (by default, Apple disables TRIM on 3rd party SSDs).\n3. Open Terminal, and type in (exactly, without the quote marks): “sudo trimforce enable”, then Y when asked ‘Do you want to proceed?’\n4. Reboot and press SHIFT (for SAFE BOOT)\n5. After boot, go to  &gt; About this Mac &gt; System Report &gt; SATA / SATA Express and see that TRIM is enabled\n6. Reboot normally, and you’re done!\n\n* Note 1: It is ALWAYS a good idea to keep at least 25% of your drive free for better system performance, so move those large files to an always-connected external device.\n* Note 2: Samsung Magician does not have a Mac version\n\nPost the upgrade from OEM Seagate 7200 rpm 1TB to Samsung 860 EVO SSD 500GB, drive speed is up almost 300%. All the spinning beachballs, unexpected shutdowns, and interminable startup times are gone. Things work at a snap (almost zero latency).\n\nSo far, I’m delighted!\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kPO9vv9RL._SY88.jpg,3,it 's like getting a new computer !,"\ n changing your computer 's internal spinning hard disk to a solid-state drive ( ssd ) is like getting a turbocharged upgrade ; add some ram , and you 've got yourself a new computer in performance terms . \ n \ nmy setup : imac 27 ” [ late 2013 ] , 1tb , 8gb ram \ nproblem : inexplicable beachballs , auto restarts , hangs , slow boots , very slow app launches . . . \ n • apple hardware test : all ok \ n • apple disk first aid : all ok / repeated corruption of snapshots \ n - approach : clean installed os , data restored from icloud and time machine . problems recurred after a week . \ n \ nmy diagnosis : ageing disk , probably with few bad sectors that apple formatting apfs was tripping over . decided to change internal hdd to ssd , and add more ram . \ n \ nsamsung 860evo 500gb seemed the best , affordable choice . would have preferred the ‘ blade ' nvme 970 pro , but it is more than double the price ; more importantly , it 's incompatible with the imac 's pin and channel configuration . \ n \ nso , i picked the samsung 860 evo and \ n ; \ n for my upgrade . \ n \ nupgrading the internal drive of a slim-profile ( 5mm ) imac is not easy . even in experienced hands , there is a very high risk of damaging the led display panel , which has to be sliced off the aluminium chassis ( see ifixit 's tutorial ) . even more dangerous is remounting the display panel , as the quality and strength of the tapes sold online are highly suspect , with many users reporting that their displays fell off and smashed after remounting with such tapes . \ n \ nthe oem adhesive strip used by apple is a custom 3m vhb tape ( 5mm wide , 1 mm thick ) . so i spoke with 3m india , and after keeping me dangling in hope for 3 weeks , they stopped taking my calls . thanks 3m . :( \ n \ nthe workaround was to shop around with apple authorised resellers / service . none of them would sell me the mounting tape separately , but they would do my disk upgrade for a price ranging from ₹ 4800 to ₹ 2500 ( tape + service ) . seemed the better option , as it mitigated the risk of damaging the display panel and ruining my mac . \ n \ npreparation :\ n • installed the crucial ram myself (8 gb x 2 slots ) . \ n • cloned my existing hard drive to the samsung ssd 860 evo , and ran it externally as the boot drive to check things out , for about a week . \ n • took my mac and new , data-loaded and bootable ssd to an apple authorised service center , on the appointed date . \ n \ n2 hours later , my upgrade was done . \ n \ ni did not buy or use a 3 . 5 to 2 . 5 ” drive adapter ; double-sided tape is sufficient to mount the ssd inside the imac 's chassis ( technicians concurred ) . neither does the ssd require an external ‘ thermal sensor ' ; it runs cool . \ n \ npost upgrade :\ n1 . the first thing to do after the ssd is the internal boot drive is to startup normally , and do a full time machine backup . \ n2 . once done , enable trim ( by default , apple disables trim on 3rd party ssds ) . \ n3 . open terminal , and type in ( exactly , without the quote marks ): “ sudo trimforce enable ” , then y when asked ‘ do you want to proceed ?

As the title says, I totally fell in love with it.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThis review is for those, who are confused regarding the hype of M50X. I personally did not like the sound signature earlier. But after a lot of tweaking with equalizer and with enabling spatial sound (Dolby Atmos for windows 10), I am slowly falling in love with these headphones. It requires time to get used to the signature of sound if you are hardcore bass lovers.\n\nSo here is my full review which I would like to break down by points :\n\n1) SOUND Quality:\n\nBASS 9/10: Excellent production of bass. After increasing bass levels in Equalizer, it just pumps right amount of bass and is very deep and punchy.\nMIDS 7 /10: Mids are okay, balanced. Vocals are crisp and bass does not overpower the mids.\nHIGHS 5 / 10: Awful. It's very bright. I had to lower down some higher frequencies in order to resolve my headache.\n\nI come from Sennheiser background where I had PX 80, PX 95, CX 175, HD 202, HD 203 and HD598 SR. I also have Sony MDR 550AP. So comparing to those, sound signature of ATH is different. If you directly plug in these headphones without configuring and tweaking equalizer as per your needs, then you would be disappointed, as I was on the first day of listening to these.\n\nI thought, maybe, I should try configuring properly. I googled frequency response and balanced equalizer as per my needs. I have uploaded my EQ settings. So below review is purely depending on my personalized EQ setting.\n\nNow, these headphone sound damn amazing, I could not believe the experience after enabling Dolby Atmos for Headphones (Windows 10 feature). It's brilliant. Even it sounds great on Windows Sonic spatial configuration. Just disable 7.1 virtual surround. Uncheck the box in sound setting. Games and movies sounds epic. High quality audio files have new dimension to it now. Especially A.R Rahman songs (Dil se and Jiya Jale recording in Berkeley University). If you love bass, these will definitely sound better than HD598. But if you love immersion and wider soundstage, no one can beat Sennheiser HD598 under 10k budget.\n\nHowever sound quality is very subjective, as many people prefer high bass, many prefer higher clarity. These headphones can be ""ADJUSTED"" according to your needs. Hence I can say, out of the box its not good, but it definitely has that capability to be the best if you give it proper attention.\n\n2) BUILD QUALITY 10/10 : Simply excellent. It feels premium. Very strong. It looks durable, many people have been using these for years. Although not sure about ear cups, as they wear out in one year or so.\n\n3) COMFORT 9/10 (Edited) : When I posted this review, I found it very difficult to wear these for long hours, but after 10 months of usage, the comfort level is far better now. I have used it for watching back to back movies, playing games for 4-6 hours straight without any issue. Although in warm weather, it may get a bit sticky. No issues in air conditioned room.\n\n4) NOISE CANCELLATION 6/10: Not that good. I can hear ambient noise. It reduces up to 50 percent. Best to listen in quiet environment.\n\n5) SOUND LEAK 10/10: Sound does not leak at all. Person sitting next to you will not be disturbed at all, even on high volume.\n\n6) Accessories 10/10 : Good carrying pouch, 3 wires as per different needs.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HMynt8IRL._SY88.jpg,3,"give it time , and you will slowly fall in love .","\ n edit : updating the rating from 4 to 5 stars , after 10 months of usage . as the title says , i totally fell in love with it . \ n___ \ nthis review is for those , who are confused regarding the hype of m50x . i personally did not like the sound signature earlier . but after a lot of tweaking with equalizer and with enabling spatial sound ( dolby atmos for windows 10 ) , i am slowly falling in love with these headphones . it requires time to get used to the signature of sound if you are hardcore bass lovers . \ n \ nso here is my full review which i would like to break down by points :\ n \ n1 ) sound quality :\ n \ nbass 9/10 : excellent production of bass . after increasing bass levels in equalizer , it just pumps right amount of bass and is very deep and punchy . \ nmids 7 / 10 : mids are okay , balanced . vocals are crisp and bass does not overpower the mids . \ nhighs 5 / 10 : awful . it 's very bright . i had to lower down some higher frequencies in order to resolve my headache . \ n \ ni come from sennheiser background where i had px 80 , px 95 , cx 175 , hd 202 , hd 203 and hd598 sr . i also have sony mdr 550ap . so comparing to those , sound signature of ath is different . if you directly plug in these headphones without configuring and tweaking equalizer as per your needs , then you would be disappointed , as i was on the first day of listening to these . \ n \ ni thought , maybe , i should try configuring properly . i googled frequency response and balanced equalizer as per my needs . i have uploaded my eq settings . so below review is purely depending on my personalized eq setting . \ n \ nnow , these headphone sound damn amazing , i could not believe the experience after enabling dolby atmos for headphones ( windows 10 feature ) . it 's brilliant . even it sounds great on windows sonic spatial configuration . just disable 7 . 1 virtual surround . uncheck the box in sound setting . games and movies sounds epic . high quality audio files have new dimension to it now . especially a . r rahman songs ( dil se and jiya jale recording in berkeley university ) . if you love bass , these will definitely sound better than hd598 . but if you love immersion and wider soundstage , no one can beat sennheiser hd598 under 10k budget . \ n \ nhowever sound quality is very subjective , as many people prefer high bass , many prefer higher clarity . these headphones can be "" adjusted "" according to your needs . hence i can say , out of the box its not good , but it definitely has that capability to be the best if you give it proper attention . \ n \ n2 ) build quality 10/10 : simply excellent . it feels premium . very strong . it looks durable , many people have been using these for years . although not sure about ear cups , as they wear out in one year or so . \ n \ n3 ) comfort 9/10 ( edited ) : when i posted this review , i found it very difficult to wear these for long hours , but after 10 months of usage , the comfort level is far better now . i have used it for watching back to back movies , playing games for 4-6 hours straight without any issue . although in warm weather , it may get a bit sticky . no issues in air conditioned room . \ n \ n4 ) noise cancellation 6/10 : not that good . i can hear ambient noise . it reduces up to 50 percent . best to listen in quiet environment . \ n \ n5 ) sound leak 10/10 : sound does not leak at all . person sitting next to you will not be disturbed at all , even on high volume . \ n \ n6 ) accessories 10/10 : good carrying pouch , 3 wires as per different needs . \ n",2735.jpg

The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.\n2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.\n3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.\n4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.\n5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.\n6. Battery life is quite very good.\n7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.\n8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.\n9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.\nCons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.\n2.

I really need a smart watch which can track my daily activity, give me a stylish look and provide me various notifications. As usual my first thought was about apple watch.\n\nWhy I preferred noise colorfit pro 2?\nApple watch is very nice, which is a real smart watch. But problem is poor battery life.\n\nDo you really think of charging ur apple watch daily?\nIn today’s life already I hv wireless earpods, loud speaker and smartphone which need to be charged daily. Really I don’t want to add one more thing to the list.\nDo you really need a smart watch to answer calls or reply messages when ur phn is in ur pocket or near by (bcoz if phn is not nearby then these features will not work)? If yes then believe me u r too lazy ??.\n\nPros of colorfit pro 2: stylish look, working flawlessly with my iPhone. I can receive all notifications, read messages, control music (working nicely with gaana app, even if gaana app is not open, by clicking play button songs can be played). The activity tracker is also working fine. Good battery life.\n\nCons: Only 5 watch faces (request to noise to update number of watch faces which ll make this watch awesome)\nUnder bright sunshine, screen is hardly visible (the only thing with respect to which amazfit bip lite is the winner)\n\nVerdict: U can definitely try this watch though it is really not a smartwatch. In India, smartwatch technology is at nascent stage. So don’t expect much as compared to smartphones. Presently Smartwatch technology in India is like smartphone technology that was 5years ago. So better wait sometimes to use this smart technology at affordable price and let the rich people to enjoy the things for now??\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NLaOEGo4L._SY88.jpg,3,smart choice over expensive smart watch,"\ n background : i have recently purchased an iphone xr . i really need a smart watch which can track my daily activity , give me a stylish look and provide me various notifications . as usual my first thought was about apple watch . \ n \ nwhy i preferred noise colorfit pro 2 ? \ napple watch is very nice , which is a real smart watch . but problem is poor battery life . \ n \ ndo you really think of charging ur apple watch daily ? \ nin today 's life already i hv wireless earpods , loud speaker and smartphone which need to be charged daily . really i do n't want to add one more thing to the list . \ ndo you really need a smart watch to answer calls or reply messages when ur phn is in ur pocket or near by ( bcoz if phn is not nearby then these features will not work ) ? if yes then believe me u r too lazy ? ? . \ n \ npros of colorfit pro 2 : stylish look , working flawlessly with my iphone . i can receive all notifications , read messages , control music ( working nicely with gaana app , even if gaana app is not open , by clicking play button songs can be played ) . the activity tracker is also working fine . good battery life . \ n \ ncons : only 5 watch faces ( request to noise to update number of watch faces which ll make this watch awesome ) \ nunder bright sunshine , screen is hardly visible ( the only thing with respect to which amazfit bip lite is the winner ) \ n \ nverdict : u can definitely try this watch though it is really not a smartwatch . in india , smartwatch technology is at nascent stage . so do n't expect much as compared to smartphones . presently smartwatch technology in india is like smartphone technology that was 5years ago . so better wait sometimes to use this smart technology at affordable price and let the rich people to enjoy the things for now ? ? \ n",1889.jpg

No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .\n4.

Awesome machine for capturing memorable moments - specially who are beginners and are planning to buy a new camera to start but getting confused - I would not say much - just look at the shots that I took and uploaded here from my camera and you yourself will come to know what I am trying to say as there is a saying ""A Pictures Speaks Thousand of Words"" (Please note- all of these uploaded pictures have taken from its kit lenses itself - I didn't use any prime lens for these blurry effects).\n\n2. I don't want to go deeper into the technicality here - I would simply recommend all to buy this camera if you are specially looking to have your Camera for general photography purpose - not for commercial use. For Day to Day photography - it's A Jack Of All Trades!\n\n3. Easy to handle 5/5\n\n4. Picture Quality/Sharpness wise - 5/5 :)\n\n5. For Beginners - just start with these two lenses first as this is fine enough - but down the line if you feel then go for other lenses such as Prime 50mm.\n\n6. Try to shot via Manual Mode/A/S/P Only (An advise for beginner only) - First start with the Auto Mode - Learn &amp; Experience it, then go with the advanced level then you will enjoy the true performance of the machine :)\n\nAt last, I would like to end by saying - Don't confuse with any other machine especially when planning to buy a beginner level camera - buy it with closed eyes :)\n\nThanks,\nParikshit\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QO+JXdHqL._SY88.jpg,3,jack of all trades - superb machine ! !,"\ n hello all , \ n \ nbefore i start writing my review , first of all , i would like to send thanks to amazon and the seller "" appario retail private ltd "" for their amazing 5 * * * service and providing me this top-notch product . \ n \ ni finally received my camera #nikon d3500 d that i ordered on 7th june 2020 with kit lens 18-55 mm vr and 70-300 mm . \ n \ nin order to cut long review short ( in a nutshell ) - \ n \ n1 . awesome machine for capturing memorable moments - specially who are beginners and are planning to buy a new camera to start but getting confused - i would not say much - just look at the shots that i took and uploaded here from my camera and you yourself will come to know what i am trying to say as there is a saying "" a pictures speaks thousand of words "" ( please note - all of these uploaded pictures have taken from its kit lenses itself - i did n't use any prime lens for these blurry effects ) . \ n \ n2 . i do n't want to go deeper into the technicality here - i would simply recommend all to buy this camera if you are specially looking to have your camera for general photography purpose - not for commercial use . for day to day photography - it 's a jack of all trades ! \ n \ n3 . easy to handle 5/5 \ n \ n4 . picture quality / sharpness wise - 5/5 :) \ n \ n5 . for beginners - just start with these two lenses first as this is fine enough - but down the line if you feel then go for other lenses such as prime 50mm . \ n \ n6 . try to shot via manual mode / a / s / p only ( an advise for beginner only ) - first start with the auto mode - learn & experience it , then go with the advanced level then you will enjoy the true performance of the machine :) \ n \ nat last , i would like to end by saying - do n't confuse with any other machine especially when planning to buy a beginner level camera - buy it with closed eyes :) \ n \ nthanks , \ nparikshit \ n",3216.jpg

It has an impact to change your perspectives towards life for the better. Also, the author has given a fine light on both the conscious and subconscious mind. As a non-fictional book, this book says a lot about many things from staying positive to controlling your mind and emotions.\n\nThough the flow is not always good in this book and even some chapters sounded too heavy that was next to impossible to tolerate. On the brighter side, some chapters were really good and on the point. That is the only reason that giving 3.5 stars out of 5 would not be a bad option at all.\n\nLastly, you can't take this one as a regular self-help book. This is a bit different and some concepts are explained superbly by the author. Anyone who likes to read a book about controlling the mind and winning life then he/she must grab this as the title goes.\n\nFav Quote: ""Busy your mind with the concepts of harmony, health, peace, and good will, and wonders will happen in your life.""\n\nRating: 3.5/5\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B173vsnKl+S._SY88.jpg,3,changing perspectives !,"\ n book review ! ! \ nthe power of your subconscious mind by dr joseph murphy . it has an impact to change your perspectives towards life for the better . also , the author has given a fine light on both the conscious and subconscious mind . as a non-fictional book , this book says a lot about many things from staying positive to controlling your mind and emotions . \ n \ nthough the flow is not always good in this book and even some chapters sounded too heavy that was next to impossible to tolerate . on the brighter side , some chapters were really good and on the point . that is the only reason that giving 3 . 5 stars out of 5 would not be a bad option at all . \ n \ nlastly , you can't take this one as a regular self-help book . this is a bit different and some concepts are explained superbly by the author . anyone who likes to read a book about controlling the mind and winning life then he / she must grab this as the title goes . \ n \ nfav quote : "" busy your mind with the concepts of harmony , health , peace , and good will , and wonders will happen in your life .

After one month of use (around 1700 pages) I am not satisfied with this product. below are my experience in detail.\n\nSPEED: Speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors EPSON L220 or EPSON L380. It has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously. this problem really tests one's patience specially when you have a lots of color copies to do.\n\nPRINT QUALITY: Print quality is average.My previous L220 prints little better images than this model. document print is below average too.. photo print is not recommended. can not pull more than 180 gsm. ONE MORE major problem is print head need to be cleaned every 2/3 days. line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be.\n\nPAGE YIELD: I wonder why Epson mark this printer as eco print. I have print only 1700 pages (mostly text only) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level, means one more step down the tank is empty. As per the EPSON web page , B&amp;W page yield should be 4500 pages. I don't think it can print half of that count. its really very disappointing should be shame for EPSON.\n\nMy verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use, doesn't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use. One star as it goes.\n",1,anger,0,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713I4zKcwZL._SY88.jpg,0,review after one month of use - does n't worth the value,"\ n i have used purchased this product as a replacement for my epson l220 . after one month of use ( around 1700 pages ) i am not satisfied with this product . below are my experience in detail . \ n \ nspeed : speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors epson l220 or epson l380 . it has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously . this problem really tests one 's patience specially when you have a lots of color copies to do . \ n \ nprint quality : print quality is average . my previous l220 prints little better images than this model . document print is below average too . . photo print is not recommended . can not pull more than 180 gsm . one more major problem is print head need to be cleaned every 2/3 days . line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be . \ n \ npage yield : i wonder why epson mark this printer as eco print . i have print only 1700 pages ( mostly text only ) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level , means one more step down the tank is empty . as per the epson web page , b & w page yield should be 4500 pages . i do n't think it can print half of that count . its really very disappointing should be shame for epson . \ n \ nmy verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use , does n't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use . one star as it goes . \ n",2288.jpg

The price just before the sale was Rs 2,696/- but on sale, it had a lightning deal of 2,499/- and I got 10% Rs 250 additional discount for HDFC Card. In Short, I got the SSD for Rs 2249/-.\nThis SSD is worth every penny. I have a Lenovo Ideapad 320-15IKB (Type 81BG, 81BT) with basic configuration ( i5 8th gen, 8GB ram and 1TB 5400 rpm HDD). After 2 years of use, the laptop became super slow, boot time was around two minutes and it used to get stuck very often (couldn't open more than 4-5 tabs in chrome at one go). Tried every tweak youtube videos had to offer but there was no visible performance improvement. Somebody suggested to buy an SSD ( I didn't wanted to spend much on it honestly ). After searching and reading comments I finally decided to go for this one. Below is my view of this product to help you decide to make an informed choice if you wish to get one:\n1. Boot time on my machine is less than 12 seconds\n2. MS office opens as soon as you click on a file (haven't seen taking more than 3 seconds)\n3. Chrome is never stuck (can open 10-12 tabs, never tried more than that but pretty sure it can handle more)\n4. Significant time reduction in transferring a file from Pendrive, hard drive, phone\n5. 2.2k for a 240gb SSD is the best deal, can't say about the coming times as technology improves but this is the best deal you can get for now\n6. Some people have written non-satisfactory reviews on this (and they have compared it with Samsung Evo, let me tell you, I am sure that is among the best SSD available, but it comes at double the price with maybe 20% extra performance, you can do the math to figure out which is a better option when it comes to value buy)\n7. Honest opinion: If you are someone looking for an SSD that offers decent performance (8-10x better than 5400rpm HDD), and don't wanna spend too much on it then this is a product for you.\n8. And lastly, enable ""Momentum Cache"" by downloading Crucial Storage Executive which will enhance your speed upto 6GBps. (Picture 1 is without enabling Momentum Cache facility and Picture 2 is using Momentum Cache facility.)\n\nI hope this review helps you in making an informed decision on buying an SSD.\nThank you.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713mmub4hFL._SY88.jpg,3,worth purchasing,"\ n i bought my crucial 240gb ssd on 16th october 2020 during the great indian festival sale . the price just before the sale was rs 2,696 / - but on sale , it had a lightning deal of 2,499 / - and i got 10 % rs 250 additional discount for hdfc card . in short , i got the ssd for rs 2249 / - . \ nthis ssd is worth every penny . i have a lenovo ideapad 320-15 ikb ( type 81bg , 81bt ) with basic configuration ( i5 8th gen , 8gb ram and 1tb 5400 rpm hdd ) . after 2 years of use , the laptop became super slow , boot time was around two minutes and it used to get stuck very often ( could n't open more than 4-5 tabs in chrome at one go ) . tried every tweak youtube videos had to offer but there was no visible performance improvement . somebody suggested to buy an ssd ( i did n't wanted to spend much on it honestly ) . after searching and reading comments i finally decided to go for this one . below is my view of this product to help you decide to make an informed choice if you wish to get one :\ n1 . boot time on my machine is less than 12 seconds \ n2 . ms office opens as soon as you click on a file ( have n't seen taking more than 3 seconds ) \ n3 . chrome is never stuck ( can open 10-12 tabs , never tried more than that but pretty sure it can handle more ) \ n4 . significant time reduction in transferring a file from pendrive , hard drive , phone \ n5 . 2 . 2 k for a 240gb ssd is the best deal , can't say about the coming times as technology improves but this is the best deal you can get for now \ n6 . some people have written non-satisfactory reviews on this ( and they have compared it with samsung evo , let me tell you , i am sure that is among the best ssd available , but it comes at double the price with maybe 20 % extra performance , you can do the math to figure out which is a better option when it comes to value buy ) \ n7 . honest opinion : if you are someone looking for an ssd that offers decent performance (8 - 10x better than 5400rpm hdd ) , and do n't wanna spend too much on it then this is a product for you . \ n8 . and lastly , enable "" momentum cache "" by downloading crucial storage executive which will enhance your speed upto 6gbps .
