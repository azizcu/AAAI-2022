Thought of upgrade my laptop itself and realized that I have to spent 60K for the latest one. So decided to give chance for my old laptop by upgrading it's RAM and HDD.\n\nSince it's an old laptop it doesn't have a m.2 or nvme SSD slot in its board. So bought this 2.5"" SSD which will perfectly fit in my 2.5"" inch SATA HDD slot. I was in doubt when I bought this whether it will work or not. Trust me this thing worked like a charm.!!! Now my laptop is superfast (as compared to my old HDD) and windows 10 boots up in few seconds. And also launching apps accessing huge files became much much faster. Now I feel like it's a new laptop.!!!\n\nOnly problem was how to clone my old HDD and OS without loosing license and data. But crucial site has all the support you need. They have step by step videos to install and upgrade your old laptop. I am not a laptop mechanic, still am able to replace my HDD myself (see the pics). They have cloning software which is free for us(there are third-party sw which does the cloning but we have to pay). Very easy to upgrade by following those docs/videos.\n\nExtremely happy for this purchase. Saved my 50K (not required to buy new laptop)\n\nConclusion:\nIf you have a old laptop with slow HDD and you don't have plan to buy new laptop or looking for cheap solution, then go for this SSD.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1VpKrHONML._SY88.jpg,3,"upgrading old 2 . 5 "" sata hdd to ssd ? then go for it .","\ n i have an old laptop (8 yr old , 2013 model hp probook 4441s ) which lags now a days because of its slow spinning 5400rpm sata hdd . thought of upgrade my laptop itself and realized that i have to spent 60k for the latest one . so decided to give chance for my old laptop by upgrading it 's ram and hdd . \ n \ nsince it 's an old laptop it does n't have a m . 2 or nvme ssd slot in its board . so bought this 2 . 5 "" ssd which will perfectly fit in my 2 . 5 "" inch sata hdd slot . i was in doubt when i bought this whether it will work or not . trust me this thing worked like a charm . ! ! ! now my laptop is superfast ( as compared to my old hdd ) and windows 10 boots up in few seconds . and also launching apps accessing huge files became much much faster . now i feel like it 's a new laptop . ! ! ! \ n \ nonly problem was how to clone my old hdd and os without loosing license and data . but crucial site has all the support you need . they have step by step videos to install and upgrade your old laptop . i am not a laptop mechanic , still am able to replace my hdd myself ( see the pics ) . they have cloning software which is free for us ( there are third-party sw which does the cloning but we have to pay ) . very easy to upgrade by following those docs / videos . \ n \ nextremely happy for this purchase . saved my 50k ( not required to buy new laptop ) \ n \ nconclusion :\ nif you have a old laptop with slow hdd and you do n't have plan to buy new laptop or looking for cheap solution , then go for this ssd . \ n"

It will boost your soul and spirits, fill your heart with longing and happiness &amp; will take you back to the time when life was simpler and fun.\n\nIt is a collection of 22 short stories told by Ajji to her grandchildren Raghu, Meenu,Anand, Krishna and their neighbourhood friends. The grandchildren come to their grandparents place during their summer vacations. Their grandparents house is away from the hustle-bustle of the city life; surrounded by greenery and open field. The children however are most excited about the stories that Ajji is going to tell them during their stay with her.\n\nThe stories told by the grandmother are short &amp; sweet moral stories. These stories deal on wide variety of topics such as importance of:\n📍 hard work &amp;honesty\n📍being down to earth, being helpful &amp; humble &amp; content &amp; loyal\n📍having presence of mind\n📍loving people unconditionally\nAll the stories will fill you up with hope and that feeling of content that you used to feel if your grandparents also told you stories.\n\nThe narration is very effective as you will be able to retain the stories for a long time. The tone is full of warmth. The book is woven in a way to make you feel nostalgic.The book brought back strong memories of my childhood when my brother &amp; me used to travel to my native place with our parents to meet our grandparents during summer &amp; winter breaks. Those memories were overwhelming. The smile that used to break on my Amma's &amp; Dadaji's face are images that I would cherish for my lifetime. It's a shame that I lost them so early.\n\n This was my first Sudha Murty book &amp; I am so glad that I picked up her book. It brought me out of my reading slump of 2 long months.

Problems recurred after a week.\n\nMy diagnosis: Ageing disk, probably with few bad sectors that Apple formatting APFS was tripping over. Decided to change internal HDD to SSD, and add more RAM.\n\nSamsung 860EVO 500GB seemed the best, affordable choice. Would have preferred the ‘blade’ NVMe 970 Pro, but it is more than double the price; more importantly, it’s incompatible with the iMac’s pin and channel configuration.\n\nSo, I picked the Samsung 860 EVO and&nbsp;\n; \n &nbsp;for my upgrade.\n\nUpgrading the internal drive of a slim-profile (5mm) iMac is not easy. Even in experienced hands, there is a very high risk of damaging the LED display panel, which has to be sliced off the aluminium chassis (see iFixit’s tutorial). Even more dangerous is remounting the display panel, as the quality and strength of the tapes sold online are highly suspect, with many users reporting that their displays fell off and smashed after remounting with such tapes.\n\nThe OEM adhesive strip used by Apple is a custom 3M VHB tape (5mm wide, 1 mm thick). So I spoke with 3M India, and after keeping me dangling in hope for 3 weeks, they stopped taking my calls. Thanks 3M. :(\n\nThe workaround was to shop around with Apple Authorised Resellers / Service. None of them would sell me the mounting tape separately, but they would do my disk upgrade for a price ranging from ₹4800 to ₹2500 (tape + service). Seemed the better option, as it mitigated the risk of damaging the display panel and ruining my Mac.\n\nPreparation:\n• Installed the Crucial RAM myself (8GB x 2 slots).\n• Cloned my existing hard drive to the Samsung SSD 860 EVO, and ran it externally as the boot drive to check things out, for about a week.\n• Took my Mac and new, data-loaded and bootable SSD to an Apple Authorised Service Center, on the appointed date.\n\n2 hours later, my upgrade was done.\n\nI did not buy or use a 3.5 to 2.5” drive adapter; double-sided tape is sufficient to mount the SSD inside the iMac’s chassis (technicians concurred). Neither does the SSD require an external ‘thermal sensor’; it runs cool.\n\nPost upgrade:\n1. The first thing to do after the SSD is the internal boot drive is to startup normally, and do a full Time Machine backup.\n2. Once done, ENABLE TRIM (by default, Apple disables TRIM on 3rd party SSDs).\n3. Open Terminal, and type in (exactly, without the quote marks): “sudo trimforce enable”, then Y when asked ‘Do you want to proceed?’\n4. Reboot and press SHIFT (for SAFE BOOT)\n5. After boot, go to  &gt; About this Mac &gt; System Report &gt; SATA / SATA Express and see that TRIM is enabled\n6. Reboot normally, and you’re done!\n\n* Note 1: It is ALWAYS a good idea to keep at least 25% of your drive free for better system performance, so move those large files to an always-connected external device.\n* Note 2: Samsung Magician does not have a Mac version\n\nPost the upgrade from OEM Seagate 7200 rpm 1TB to Samsung 860 EVO SSD 500GB, drive speed is up almost 300%. All the spinning beachballs, unexpected shutdowns, and interminable startup times are gone. Things work at a snap (almost zero latency).\n\nSo far, I’m delighted!\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kPO9vv9RL._SY88.jpg,3,it 's like getting a new computer !,"\ n changing your computer 's internal spinning hard disk to a solid-state drive ( ssd ) is like getting a turbocharged upgrade ; add some ram , and you 've got yourself a new computer in performance terms . \ n \ nmy setup : imac 27 ” [ late 2013 ] , 1tb , 8gb ram \ nproblem : inexplicable beachballs , auto restarts , hangs , slow boots , very slow app launches . . . \ n • apple hardware test : all ok \ n • apple disk first aid : all ok / repeated corruption of snapshots \ n - approach : clean installed os , data restored from icloud and time machine . problems recurred after a week . \ n \ nmy diagnosis : ageing disk , probably with few bad sectors that apple formatting apfs was tripping over . decided to change internal hdd to ssd , and add more ram . \ n \ nsamsung 860evo 500gb seemed the best , affordable choice . would have preferred the ‘ blade ' nvme 970 pro , but it is more than double the price ; more importantly , it 's incompatible with the imac 's pin and channel configuration . \ n \ nso , i picked the samsung 860 evo and \ n ; \ n for my upgrade . \ n \ nupgrading the internal drive of a slim-profile ( 5mm ) imac is not easy . even in experienced hands , there is a very high risk of damaging the led display panel , which has to be sliced off the aluminium chassis ( see ifixit 's tutorial ) . even more dangerous is remounting the display panel , as the quality and strength of the tapes sold online are highly suspect , with many users reporting that their displays fell off and smashed after remounting with such tapes . \ n \ nthe oem adhesive strip used by apple is a custom 3m vhb tape ( 5mm wide , 1 mm thick ) . so i spoke with 3m india , and after keeping me dangling in hope for 3 weeks , they stopped taking my calls . thanks 3m . :( \ n \ nthe workaround was to shop around with apple authorised resellers / service . none of them would sell me the mounting tape separately , but they would do my disk upgrade for a price ranging from ₹ 4800 to ₹ 2500 ( tape + service ) . seemed the better option , as it mitigated the risk of damaging the display panel and ruining my mac . \ n \ npreparation :\ n • installed the crucial ram myself (8 gb x 2 slots ) . \ n • cloned my existing hard drive to the samsung ssd 860 evo , and ran it externally as the boot drive to check things out , for about a week . \ n • took my mac and new , data-loaded and bootable ssd to an apple authorised service center , on the appointed date . \ n \ n2 hours later , my upgrade was done . \ n \ ni did not buy or use a 3 . 5 to 2 . 5 ” drive adapter ; double-sided tape is sufficient to mount the ssd inside the imac 's chassis ( technicians concurred ) . neither does the ssd require an external ‘ thermal sensor ' ; it runs cool . \ n \ npost upgrade :\ n1 . the first thing to do after the ssd is the internal boot drive is to startup normally , and do a full time machine backup . \ n2 . once done , enable trim ( by default , apple disables trim on 3rd party ssds ) . \ n3 . open terminal , and type in ( exactly , without the quote marks ): “ sudo trimforce enable ” , then y when asked ‘ do you want to proceed ?

Some of those were gifted by well-meaning friends. Some of them were books I bought on an impulse. Then there were books that I had waited years to read only to find them unworthy of all those years of patience. But this book by Yuval Noah Harari tops the list. Just imagine reading a book that all your friends were going gaga about, only to find that there is nothing worthwhile in it and wondering whether you are really a good reader at all, now that you don’t even like a book that the whole world around you seems to love!\n\nLet’s clear a few things first, before you think of bashing me up. This is a commendable effort by Mr. Harari to summarize the whole history of mankind and its evolutionary tale. During the initial pages, I too thought that this will be one of the best reads on anthropology. But this book promises a lot only to deceive. We statisticians use the term confirmation bias, which means the tendency to favor and present only those information that are supportive to one’s beliefs. This book is full of them. Harari had decided to present all that is wicked and weak about Homo Sapiens and he has succeeded to a large extent.\n\nNot that I am complaining. I for one have never held the notion that we humans are special beings sitting atop the food chain, placed there by a favorable god who created us all in his (or, is it a ‘her’?) own image. I think of us as a different species of apes that managed to evolve a little quicker than our cousins. Despite our use of advanced languages, costly clothes and snazzy gadgets, internally we remain the beasts that roamed the vast forests once. I see nothing special about being human. This book helped cement that belief in my mind by discussing the idiocies and idiosyncrasies of our species as a whole.\n\nBut that’s just about it. This book isn’t ‘a brief history of humankind’, but the opinions of Mr. Harari about the various aspects of human evolution. This isn’t a chronological history in the lines of ‘What on Earth Happened?’ by Christopher Lloyd or ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’ by Bill Bryson, both of which I found to be far more informative and interesting than this one. This is both a philosophical take and passing of judgments by Mr. Harari on what he considers to be the vital cogs of human evolution, namely Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution &amp; Scientific Revolution. There is nothing that you end up learning that you already didn’t learn, especially in case you had read those two aforementioned books.\n\nSorry, dear friends.

Therefore, if you see that it's too liquidy, it's GOOD. It signifies that no emulsifiers had been used, which other companies such as Sundrop and Disano use. However, to get the solid texture back, mix the peanut butter for a while (it was quite a job to do in the 2.5 KG box), and put it in the fridge. It'll have a solid texture by the next morning.

You'll get used to the taste quite soon, it's like an unflavored protein powder, or like pure paneer, if you get my point. No special taste, neither good nor bad.

But I wont lie like 10x speed,"\n I rated 5 stars. This shows I am satisfied with the product. However I like to write few things here being an Video editor and Designer.\nBefore 2 years i purchased Dell Inspiron 15 5000 series laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz 2.70 GHz 8gb ram. After an year I added another 8gb ram. Things helped a little while working with premiere pro or photoshop. Still lightroom took massive 30 or 40 seconds to load. Also Premiere got hanged for 3-5 seconds many times during color grading (not crash). Also crashed many times while working on text layers. Now after 2.5 hard years I just replaced inbuilt 2 TB HDD with this newly bought 1TB Samsung 860 EVO. Now let me write the differences happened.\n\nPros:\nBoot time just 5 -8 seconds. Installed 2021 version of Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Blender 3D, After effects, etc., Lightroom opens so quickly now which is a masiive surprise. Premiere pro no hang at all. However windows crashed 3 times which i assume as software issue. Photoshop 2021 also comfortable to open and work when premiere pro is rendering a HD video file. File transfer speed inside different drives is 100-150mbps normally (practially 100-150 not 300-400mbps). After this SSD purchase honestly I admit my tensions were reduced so much while working on video editing. with 10K investment, I would say this is also a Health Investment for me (lol) as I am free now of from unwanted tensions.\n\nCons:\nCons is really not a cons at all. Just want to remind some facts and say don't over expect everything on this SSD alone. Recently i transfered 8 tb of files from different external hard disks. Some i copied to system and moved. Others were USB 3.0 to USB 2.0 and 1 significantly 128gb SSD. Here comes my point. SSD to SSD means it must be top speed. Right?\nI copied 30 gb from system to 128 gb sandisk SSD. for this I used Sata to USB 2.0 cable as thats what I had. The average transfer speed was just 37 mbps. Though I still take the blame on USB 2.0 cable, things like this happens. Some peoples just blame their PC SSD blindly. USB cable and USB port also matters.\n\nSo for this reason, I always copy my video files to system SSD itself. 1 TB is very limited for guys who work multiple projects at same time. But considering the amount we spend on this SSD and how much it helps alone matters here.\nfor me its very fine to work 2 wedding projects at the same time. Everything is so cool with this SSD purchase.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81c591IvwdL._SY88.jpg,3,better for sure . but i wont lie like 10x speed,"\ n i rated 5 stars . this shows i am satisfied with the product . however i like to write few things here being an video editor and designer . \ nbefore 2 years i purchased dell inspiron 15 5000 series laptop with intel ( r ) core ( tm ) i5 - 7200u cpu 2 . 50 ghz 2 . 70 ghz 8gb ram . after an year i added another 8gb ram . things helped a little while working with premiere pro or photoshop . still lightroom took massive 30 or 40 seconds to load . also premiere got hanged for 3-5 seconds many times during color grading ( not crash ) . also crashed many times while working on text layers . now after 2 . 5 hard years i just replaced inbuilt 2 tb hdd with this newly bought 1tb samsung 860 evo . now let me write the differences happened . \ n \ npros :\ nboot time just 5 - 8 seconds . installed 2021 version of lightroom , photoshop , premiere pro , blender 3d , after effects , etc . , lightroom opens so quickly now which is a masiive surprise . premiere pro no hang at all . however windows crashed 3 times which i assume as software issue . photoshop 2021 also comfortable to open and work when premiere pro is rendering a hd video file . file transfer speed inside different drives is 100-150 mbps normally ( practially 100-150 not 300-400 mbps ) . after this ssd purchase honestly i admit my tensions were reduced so much while working on video editing . with 10k investment , i would say this is also a health investment for me ( lol ) as i am free now of from unwanted tensions . \ n \ ncons :\ ncons is really not a cons at all . just want to remind some facts and say do n't over expect everything on this ssd alone . recently i transfered 8 tb of files from different external hard disks . some i copied to system and moved . others were usb 3 . 0 to usb 2 . 0 and 1 significantly 128gb ssd . here comes my point . ssd to ssd means it must be top speed . right ? \ ni copied 30 gb from system to 128 gb sandisk ssd . for this i used sata to usb 2 . 0 cable as thats what i had . the average transfer speed was just 37 mbps . though i still take the blame on usb 2 . 0 cable , things like this happens . some peoples just blame their pc ssd blindly . usb cable and usb port also matters . \ n \ nso for this reason , i always copy my video files to system ssd itself . 1 tb is very limited for guys who work multiple projects at same time . but considering the amount we spend on this ssd and how much it helps alone matters here . \ nfor me its very fine to work 2 wedding projects at the same time . everything is so cool with this ssd purchase . \ n"

MiBand crusher.","\n &nbsp;Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself. I wanted to get an Apple Watch for my wife as I was impressed by the design but fortunately I found this Noise ColorFit Pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the Apple watch. Bought this one for Rs.2999.\n\n----------------------\n?? IN THE BOX\n----------------------\n? The smart watch module with screen protector applied\n? 22mm wide TPU strap\n? Charging cable\n? Instruction Manual and Warranty Registration card\n\n--------------------\n? FEATURES\n--------------------\n? 1.3 inch 240x240 capacitive display\n? Curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating,\n? IP68 Full dustproof and waterproof\n? 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage, 45 days standby\n? Bluetooth 5.0 BLE\n? 24/7 heart Rate sensor, sedentary alarm, breathe feature, and usual health and sleep monitoring.\n? App, message, social media and call notifications.\n? Music control\n? Menstrual cycle tracking\n? 9 sports mode - Walk, Yoga, Spin, Run, Climb, Workout, Bike, Hike, Treadmill.\n\n---------------------\n??? MY USAGE\n---------------------\n? At just 35g weight and 22mm TPU band makes this band the very comfortable to wear. Also the strap is skin friendly and I didn’t get allergy with sweat on this band.\n? The straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type.\n? The charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything. I felt this type of charging the easiest of all.\n? The looks is very premium, though is made up of polycarbonate, the grey and black colors, the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an Apple Watch.\n? There are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the Apple watch face design. As of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited, I hope customizations will be made available.\n? The display is beautiful and under direct sunlight I found the watch display visible, though not the best visibility but to a certain extent.\n? There is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button. I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.\n? The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).\n? Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.\n? The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.\n? I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.\n? There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.\n\n-------------------------\n?? WHAT I LIKED\n-------------------------\n? The premium design and great display. Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.\n? Battery life of 7 to 10 days.\n? IPX68 dust and waterproof.\n? Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring\n? Better control &amp; display of calls, messages and music from the band\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n?? WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED\n-------------------------------------------------\n? More exercise or activities could have been included like Badminton etc.\n? Only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year.\n\n-------------------\n?? OVERALL\n-------------------\nThe MiBand 4 is definitely feature rich and Noise ColorFit Pro 2 has similar or a bit more features, I found this one much better in areas like build, design, charging. I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. ??\n",1,surprise,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-WEwjw55L._SY88.jpg,5,"4 . 5 ? awesome design , good specs and features . miband crusher .","\ n most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself . i wanted to get an apple watch for my wife as i was impressed by the design but fortunately i found this noise colorfit pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the apple watch . bought this one for rs . 2999 . \ n \ n - - - \ n ? ? in the box \ n - - - \ n ? the smart watch module with screen protector applied \ n ? 22mm wide tpu strap \ n ? charging cable \ n ? instruction manual and warranty registration card \ n \ n - - - \ n ? features \ n - - - \ n ? 1 . 3 inch 240x240 capacitive display \ n ? curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating , \ n ? ip68 full dustproof and waterproof \ n ? 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage , 45 days standby \ n ? bluetooth 5 . 0 ble \ n ? 24/7 heart rate sensor , sedentary alarm , breathe feature , and usual health and sleep monitoring . \ n ? app , message , social media and call notifications . \ n ? music control \ n ? menstrual cycle tracking \ n ? 9 sports mode - walk , yoga , spin , run , climb , workout , bike , hike , treadmill . \ n \ n - - - \ n ? ? ? my usage \ n - - - \ n ? at just 35g weight and 22mm tpu band makes this band the very comfortable to wear . also the strap is skin friendly and i did n't get allergy with sweat on this band . \ n ? the straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type . \ n ? the charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything . i felt this type of charging the easiest of all . \ n ? the looks is very premium , though is made up of polycarbonate , the grey and black colors , the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an apple watch . \ n ? there are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the apple watch face design . as of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited , i hope customizations will be made available . \ n ? the display is beautiful and under direct sunlight i found the watch display visible , though not the best visibility but to a certain extent . \ n ? there is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button . i found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button . \ n ? the ip68 certification means now i i do n't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth ( ip_8 ) and also no need to worry about dirt ( ip6_ ) . \ n ? health , fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion , and surprisingly the noisefit sport app is also good . the breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe . i found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off , it takes to almost 10 days . \ n ? the sleep , heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion . most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available . \ n ? i can now read messages and notification from the band easily . from the app i was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations . \ n ? there are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone , turn off / on continuous heart rate monitoring , do not disturb , wrist . the female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion . \ n \ n - - - \ n ? ? what i liked \ n - - - \ n ? the premium design and great display . much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion . \ n ? battery life of 7 to 10 days . \ n ? ipx 68 dust and waterproof . \ n ? pretty accurate fitness , health and sleep monitoring \ n ? better control & display of calls , messages and music from the band \ n \ n - - - \ n ? ? what i felt can be improved \ n - - - \ n ? more exercise or activities could have been included like badminton etc . \ n ? only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year . \ n \ n - - - \ n ? ? overall \ n - - - \ nthe miband 4 is definitely feature rich and noise colorfit pro 2 has similar or a bit more features , i found this one much better in areas like build , design , charging . i do n't have a honor band so i can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best . ? ? \ n"

Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone.

May Disappoint - Dependent on Reader's Expectation.,"\n The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.\n\nThe book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.\n\nThe chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.\n\nI was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.\n\nThe hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy. Bought it for INR 460 against MRP of INR 499.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+tJMylj6L._SY88.jpg,3,simple & light reading . may disappoint - dependent on reader 's expectation .,"\ n the book does a decent job of relating the concept of ikigai to modern day psychology ( with frankl 's logotherapy from man 's search for meaning among others ) and a few scientific references in a simple manner . it talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man 's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself . it also tackles some ways to ' find your flow ' and ensure that what you do receives 100 % of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating . \ n \ nthe book also discusses certain other japanese concepts like takumi ( specialized workers ) and moai ( connections with community or friend-circle ) . the brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice . the book also delves into japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency . but again , maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same . \ n \ nthe chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus , may be more useful . certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of ' hara hachi bu ' wherein one eats only 80 % of what would actually assuage his hunger . the chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps . while they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them , progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient . \ n \ ni was interested in the concept of ikigai and wanted to read more about it . despite being well-written and presenting modern applications , the book did not fulfill my requirements at all . some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research , including on-site interviews , done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts . \ n \ nthe hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture . inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge . the font size is good . the spine as well as pages hold up well . overall , the book is quite light and sturdy . bought it for inr 460 against mrp of inr 499 . \ n"

The Amazon installation team didn't show up for 8 days after the TV was delivered. Thankfully we had an option where in we could book an Mi technician for the Mi app. Well I know even teenager can easily setup the TV but if you do it yourself it will void warranty and that is why you have to wait for there technician to arrive who by the way was very quick. Alright let's move to pros and Cons...\n\nPros...\n1. Value for money.\n2. Looks great and is light weight.\n3. It's got both Android as well as Patchwall. And with a strong WiFi connection you won't need Cable or Dish antenna connection any more.\n4. For an average room the built in speakers are enough.\n5. Patch wall has a lot of free content to offer and when connected to your Android phone there is whole lot of possible things that you can do, being able to play Pub g on medium settings is my favourite.\n6. You can connect your pendrive to side load apps as well.\n7. trick: Side load thopp TV app to watch paid content for free.\n8. Voice command on Mi remote works as good as in any Android phone.\n\nCons..\n1.

Waste of money and time! 😑,"\n Edit: The third pic shows you what I had to go through, to get the phone repaired from Samsung service centre!! No social distancing, and many were not wearing masks properly! Read on...\n\nI wondered how Samsung is able to sell these mobiles (M series) at such an affordable prices competing with Mi, Oppo, and Vivo! Now I know the secret, it is done by lowering the “quality”! The M31 I bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months! It started as a small blue “dot” at the left corner and grown to an “inch wide” blue patch on the screen! Boom, within a week, you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across. See the images.\n\nWhen we visited the Samsung service centre, traveling for about 80kms, the reception was extremely poor and rude! The person standing at the store entrance said “this is not covered under warranty” without even having a technician checking what is the problem! Basically looks like they are all trained to say that line. When we insisted to check what is the problem, the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin (apparently it is a very minor one, that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses), that we never understood. Another thing I noticed is, most of the people at the service centre are with their “Samsung M series” mobiles in hand, which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them!!\n\nWe had to give the phone for display replacement, that costed us another ~6K on top of the 17K we spent for this! I could have bought Oneplus Nord by spending another 5K on top!!

I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.\nAfter this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.\nI like the look &amp; feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.\nOverall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front &amp; rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.\nFor me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).\nIn short, I would say, it is a value for money device.\nI purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.\nI have used the camera in the last 5 months.

The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.\n2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.\n3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.\n4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.\n5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.\n6. Battery life is quite very good.\n7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.\n8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.\n9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.\nCons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.\n2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.\n3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.\n4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.\n5. The charging is a bit slow.\n6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.\n7. The sound output could have been more.\n8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.\n9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.\nThe phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage.

The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.\n\nAnother area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review\n\nThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThat said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.\n\nIn low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThe smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.\n\nComing to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.\n\nOn the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MJ5tDk4OL._SY88.jpg,3,worth for every penny,"\ n let 's start with the first strong point of the samsung galaxy m31 , the design . the phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000 mah battery . the phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand , though the one-handed operation is not that great . the sides are slightly curved , which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach . the phone is available in two colour options , ocean blue and space black . we got the latter for review and it sure looks premium , though it picks up fingerprints and smudges , so putting in a case is the best option . \ n \ nanother area where the galaxy m31 does a good job is the display . the smartphone is loaded with a 6 . 4- inch full hd + infinity u display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels . the display is protected with corning gorilla glass 3 protection . the display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing . furthermore , the phone supports widevine l1 support , meaning that you can stream hd content on netflix and amazon prime videos . \ n \ nsamsung galaxy m31 : camera review \ n \ nthe galaxy m31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras . the phone is loaded with a 64 -

Keyboard: 9/10, Mouse: 7/10, read to know why","\n The first impressions of both the keyboard and the mouse were awesome! I needed these for programming as well as gaming. Here's a more detailed overview on the products:\n\n1) Keyboard\n\nQuality (9/10): The top panel is completely metal built, which gives a really premium feeling to it. The keyboard is heavy enough to justify its quality.\n\nTyping experience (9/10): Really good. If you're coming from a regular keyboard then you're gonna love it. The keys are pressed softly and still gives good haptic feedback. It's a great gaming keyboard too, because if you need to press the same keys multiple times quickly, the keyup timing is really snappy which gives you an edge over regular or other gaming keyboards. Of course, the typing experience is not as great as fully functional mechanical keyboards but then, for the price, it's no less either.\n\nLooks (10/10): The keyboard looks super ergonomic, thanks to its metallic design, stylish edges, cuts and RGB lights. There is a set of 3 RGB lights combinations, you can switch among them using the dedicated light key. It also allows you to turn them off in case you don't want them on (during the day?).\n\n2) Mouse\n\nQuality (7/10): I don't know what's wrong with the mouse but the build quality somehow feels cheaper than the keyboard. I've used a Dragonwar mouse before (ELE-G9) and the quality was much better comparatively. However, the mouse is highy responsive and performs really well.\n\nExperience (8/10): The primary button clicks work amazingly well. There are 2 additional keys at the left side which can be used as 'Forward' and 'Backward' buttons. These buttons come really handy while browsing the web as you don't need to move your mouse to the navigation bar of your web browser to navigate. I feel the buttons are a little misplaced though, The 'Forward' button is okay, but to click on the 'Backward' button, I need to move my thumb a bit towards the palm. This wouldn't be the issue if the buttons were placed a little more towards the primary buttons. The fifth button helps in changing the DPI, and it works, serves the purpose just right.\n\nPrice for money?\nAbsolutely. I bought it for 1200, the price is of course higher than it's normal SP, but then it's expected to be so because of the current situations. Even if I'm not counting much on the mouse for durability, the keyboard alone justifies the price to be honest.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N+pq82pxL._SY88.jpg,3,"worth the bucks ! keyboard : 9/10 , mouse : 7/10 , read to know why","\ n the first impressions of both the keyboard and the mouse were awesome ! i needed these for programming as well as gaming . here 's a more detailed overview on the products :\ n \ n1 ) keyboard \ n \ nquality ( 9/10 ): the top panel is completely metal built , which gives a really premium feeling to it . the keyboard is heavy enough to justify its quality . \ n \ ntyping experience ( 9/10 ): really good . if you 're coming from a regular keyboard then you 're gonna love it . the keys are pressed softly and still gives good haptic feedback . it 's a great gaming keyboard too , because if you need to press the same keys multiple times quickly , the keyup timing is really snappy which gives you an edge over regular or other gaming keyboards . of course , the typing experience is not as great as fully functional mechanical keyboards but then , for the price , it 's no less either . \ n \ nlooks ( 10/10 ): the keyboard looks super ergonomic , thanks to its metallic design , stylish edges , cuts and rgb lights . there is a set of 3 rgb lights combinations , you can switch among them using the dedicated light key . it also allows you to turn them off in case you do n't want them on ( during the day ? ) . \ n \ n2 ) mouse \ n \ nquality ( 7/10 ): i do n't know what 's wrong with the mouse but the build quality somehow feels cheaper than the keyboard . i 've used a dragonwar mouse before ( ele-g 9 ) and the quality was much better comparatively . however , the mouse is highy responsive and performs really well . \ n \ nexperience (8 / 10 ): the primary button clicks work amazingly well . there are 2 additional keys at the left side which can be used as ' forward ' and ' backward ' buttons . these buttons come really handy while browsing the web as you do n't need to move your mouse to the navigation bar of your web browser to navigate . i feel the buttons are a little misplaced though , the ' forward ' button is okay , but to click on the ' backward ' button , i need to move my thumb a bit towards the palm . this would n't be the issue if the buttons were placed a little more towards the primary buttons . the fifth button helps in changing the dpi , and it works , serves the purpose just right . \ n \ nprice for money ? \ nabsolutely . i bought it for 1200 , the price is of course higher than it 's normal sp , but then it 's expected to be so because of the current situations . even if i 'm not counting much on the mouse for durability , the keyboard alone justifies the price to be honest . \ n"

One fine day she acquires a beautiful bright blue umbrella from some picnickers who came at the hills of Garhwal in exchange of her lucky leopard’s claw necklace.

Features and specifications:\nToday I am looking at the new 860 EVO to see how Samsung has improved on the world's best selling SSD. Samsung's EVO series is so popular in some countries that it outsells every other SSD by a two to one margin. Samsung wants to leverage that proven formula with the new EVO series so it can cling to its dominant and profitable leadership position. Samsung changes its pricing when competitors close in, and the company always releases a faster model when others get too close to matching its performance.\nSamsung 860 EVO (250GB)\nCapacity (Raw / User)\n256GB / 250GB\nForm Factor\n2.5"" / M.2 2280 S3 / mSATA\nInterface / Protocol\nSATA / AHCI\nController\nSamsung MJX\n\n2. Features\nSamsung outfitted the 860 series with a new MJX controller that supports low-power DDR4 memory, so it likely has a new integrated memory controller. We also suspect the company built the MJX controller on a smaller lithography that enables lower power consumption, cooler operation, and reduced manufacturing costs.\nIf you have been an engineer either computer or electrical engineer or both you must see this following point.\n\n3.Software &amp; Accessories\nWe were able to test the latest version of Samsung's Magician software now that the drives are actually on the market. The new 860 series and the 850 non-Pro/EVO from China are now supported. They also work with Rapid Mode, which is Samsung's DRAM cache algorithm that increases performance and reduces wear on the flash.\n\n4.Packaging (Check pics included in the review)\nCan you guess what Samsung's tagline is for the 860 EVO? ""The SSD That Makes A Difference"" is emblazoned on both the front and back of the package. The warranty on the retail package. Samsung doesn't mention performance, endurance, or any other metric you might use in a retail store to compare this product to the one next to it.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D54s3AvaL._SY88.jpg,3,the 860 evo review : samsung back on top,"\ n i can proportionate my review on following points as everyone wishes to update his or her laptop or desktop to new generation laptop . \ n1 . features and specifications :\ ntoday i am looking at the new 860 evo to see how samsung has improved on the world 's best selling ssd . samsung 's evo series is so popular in some countries that it outsells every other ssd by a two to one margin . samsung wants to leverage that proven formula with the new evo series so it can cling to its dominant and profitable leadership position . samsung changes its pricing when competitors close in , and the company always releases a faster model when others get too close to matching its performance . \ nsamsung 860 evo ( 250gb ) \ ncapacity ( raw / user ) \ n256gb / 250gb \ nform factor \ n2 . 5 "" / m . 2 2280 s3 / msata \ ninterface / protocol \ nsata / ahci \ ncontroller \ nsamsung mjx \ n \ n2 . features \ nsamsung outfitted the 860 series with a new mjx controller that supports low-power ddr 4 memory , so it likely has a new integrated memory controller . we also suspect the company built the mjx controller on a smaller lithography that enables lower power consumption , cooler operation , and reduced manufacturing costs . \ nif you have been an engineer either computer or electrical engineer or both you must see this following point . \ n \ n3 . software & accessories \ nwe were able to test the latest version of samsung 's magician software now that the drives are actually on the market . the new 860 series and the 850 non-pro / evo from china are now supported . they also work with rapid mode , which is samsung 's dram cache algorithm that increases performance and reduces wear on the flash . \ n \ n4 . packaging ( check pics included in the review ) \ ncan you guess what samsung 's tagline is for the 860 evo ?

After one month of use (around 1700 pages) I am not satisfied with this product. below are my experience in detail.\n\nSPEED: Speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors EPSON L220 or EPSON L380. It has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously. this problem really tests one's patience specially when you have a lots of color copies to do.\n\nPRINT QUALITY: Print quality is average.My previous L220 prints little better images than this model. document print is below average too.. photo print is not recommended. can not pull more than 180 gsm. ONE MORE major problem is print head need to be cleaned every 2/3 days. line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be.\n\nPAGE YIELD: I wonder why Epson mark this printer as eco print. I have print only 1700 pages (mostly text only) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level, means one more step down the tank is empty. As per the EPSON web page , B&amp;W page yield should be 4500 pages. I don't think it can print half of that count. its really very disappointing should be shame for EPSON.\n\nMy verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use, doesn't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use. One star as it goes.\n",1,anger,0,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713I4zKcwZL._SY88.jpg,0,review after one month of use - does n't worth the value,"\ n i have used purchased this product as a replacement for my epson l220 . after one month of use ( around 1700 pages ) i am not satisfied with this product . below are my experience in detail . \ n \ nspeed : speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors epson l220 or epson l380 . it has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously . this problem really tests one 's patience specially when you have a lots of color copies to do . \ n \ nprint quality : print quality is average . my previous l220 prints little better images than this model . document print is below average too . . photo print is not recommended . can not pull more than 180 gsm . one more major problem is print head need to be cleaned every 2/3 days . line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be . \ n \ npage yield : i wonder why epson mark this printer as eco print . i have print only 1700 pages ( mostly text only ) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level , means one more step down the tank is empty . as per the epson web page , b & w page yield should be 4500 pages . i do n't think it can print half of that count . its really very disappointing should be shame for epson . \ n \ nmy verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use , does n't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use . one star as it goes . \ n"

Some of those were gifted by well-meaning friends. Some of them were books I bought on an impulse. Then there were books that I had waited years to read only to find them unworthy of all those years of patience. But this book by Yuval Noah Harari tops the list. Just imagine reading a book that all your friends were going gaga about, only to find that there is nothing worthwhile in it and wondering whether you are really a good reader at all, now that you don’t even like a book that the whole world around you seems to love!\n\nLet’s clear a few things first, before you think of bashing me up. This is a commendable effort by Mr. Harari to summarize the whole history of mankind and its evolutionary tale. During the initial pages, I too thought that this will be one of the best reads on anthropology. But this book promises a lot only to deceive. We statisticians use the term confirmation bias, which means the tendency to favor and present only those information that are supportive to one’s beliefs. This book is full of them. Harari had decided to present all that is wicked and weak about Homo Sapiens and he has succeeded to a large extent.\n\nNot that I am complaining. I for one have never held the notion that we humans are special beings sitting atop the food chain, placed there by a favorable god who created us all in his (or, is it a ‘her’?) own image. I think of us as a different species of apes that managed to evolve a little quicker than our cousins. Despite our use of advanced languages, costly clothes and snazzy gadgets, internally we remain the beasts that roamed the vast forests once. I see nothing special about being human. This book helped cement that belief in my mind by discussing the idiocies and idiosyncrasies of our species as a whole.\n\nBut that’s just about it. This book isn’t ‘a brief history of humankind’, but the opinions of Mr. Harari about the various aspects of human evolution. This isn’t a chronological history in the lines of ‘What on Earth Happened?’ by Christopher Lloyd or ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’ by Bill Bryson, both of which I found to be far more informative and interesting than this one. This is both a philosophical take and passing of judgments by Mr. Harari on what he considers to be the vital cogs of human evolution, namely Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution &amp; Scientific Revolution. There is nothing that you end up learning that you already didn’t learn, especially in case you had read those two aforementioned books.\n\nSorry, dear friends.

Exynos processor dissapoints,"\n It's a great phone to buy on Big sales or Deep discount sales days. The phone is definitely worth buying for 14k or less but not beyond that. The Exynos processor is what made me think twice. Would have beeen great if they had SD processor. Nontheless Exynos does a decent job but definitely nowhere near Qualcomm SD.\n\nPros\n* Amoled - Display is pretty good\n* Camera - Camera is extremely good for a phone priced at 14k\n* Sound - Not that clear/sharp while attending calls but Ok, not bad either\n* Battery - super good.. lasts 1 day on heavy use and 1.5days for normal use\n\ncons\n* Processor - Exynos instead of SD\n* Battery charging - says fast charging but takes at least 2.5 hours for full charge\n* Packaging - No laminated one time use screen protector (the laminated kind of sheet) is provided. Tempered glass has to be put immediately after receiving to prevent unnecessary scratches or damages.\n* Silicon Cover - it would hardly cost 10/- or 20/- for the manufacturer, they should have provided a basic mobile cover\n* Audio - not that great even with Samsung headphones..listening to music won't be a great experience even if you enable dolby or whatever the feature it has got\n* Screen size - 6.7 inches would have been better\n* Bloatware - Too many bloatware..unnecessary and annoying\n\nOverall - It does a pretty good job. For 14k or below, just go for it..\n\nafter 3months of usage:\nPhone is good, got android 11 update as well..\nfew annoying things to be noted are\n1) during calls, the hold or record button gets enabled when the ear touches the sides of the pannels. I couldn't find a way to disable this on call menu. What I do is, put the phone into home screen and lock the screen as soon as I attend the call or when my calls gets picked\n\n2) Bloatware - Too many bloatwares and Galaxy store updates apps of its liking. So I disbaled Galaxy store\n\n3) Power cord - the length of the cord is way less than cords provided by any other brands.

Light as a feather. Needs to have some weight, some minimum weight.\n\n2. Airy Side buttons though they work have no feel. People who experienced these kind of buttons can tell, they don't last more than a few days and also you can't physically feel any click, absolutely zero tactile feel except for a very faint click sound.

Very elevated: The metal plate lies flat on table and keys are very elevated. It's insanely difficult to type keeping your wrist straight. While gaming there is zero wrist support.
