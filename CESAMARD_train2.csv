Waste of money and time! 😑,"\n Edit: The third pic shows you what I had to go through, to get the phone repaired from Samsung service centre!! No social distancing, and many were not wearing masks properly! Read on...\n\nI wondered how Samsung is able to sell these mobiles (M series) at such an affordable prices competing with Mi, Oppo, and Vivo! Now I know the secret, it is done by lowering the “quality”! The M31 I bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months! It started as a small blue “dot” at the left corner and grown to an “inch wide” blue patch on the screen! Boom, within a week, you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across. See the images.\n\nWhen we visited the Samsung service centre, traveling for about 80kms, the reception was extremely poor and rude! The person standing at the store entrance said “this is not covered under warranty” without even having a technician checking what is the problem! Basically looks like they are all trained to say that line. When we insisted to check what is the problem, the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin (apparently it is a very minor one, that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses), that we never understood. Another thing I noticed is, most of the people at the service centre are with their “Samsung M series” mobiles in hand, which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them!!\n\nWe had to give the phone for display replacement, that costed us another ~6K on top of the 17K we spent for this! I could have bought Oneplus Nord by spending another 5K on top!! Waste of money and time 😑😑😑\n\nIt’s a clear no to buy Samsung M Series!!!\n",1,disgust,0,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7iq5FE9L._SY88.jpg,1,a big noo for samsung m series ! ! ! waste of money and time ! :expressionless_face:,"\ n edit : the third pic shows you what i had to go through , to get the phone repaired from samsung service centre ! ! no social distancing , and many were not wearing masks properly ! read on . . . \ n \ ni wondered how samsung is able to sell these mobiles ( m series ) at such an affordable prices competing with mi , oppo , and vivo ! now i know the secret , it is done by lowering the “ quality ” ! the m31 i bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months ! it started as a small blue “ dot ” at the left corner and grown to an “ inch wide ” blue patch on the screen ! boom , within a week , you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across . see the images . \ n \ nwhen we visited the samsung service centre , traveling for about 80kms , the reception was extremely poor and rude ! the person standing at the store entrance said “ this is not covered under warranty ” without even having a technician checking what is the problem ! basically looks like they are all trained to say that line . when we insisted to check what is the problem , the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin ( apparently it is a very minor one , that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses ) , that we never understood . another thing i noticed is , most of the people at the service centre are with their “ samsung m series ” mobiles in hand , which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them ! ! \ n \ nwe had to give the phone for display replacement , that costed us another ~ 6k on top of the 17k we spent for this ! i could have bought oneplus nord by spending another 5k on top ! ! waste of money and time :expressionless_face: :expressionless_face: :expressionless_face: \ n \ nit 's a clear no to buy samsung m series ! ! ! \ n",2426.jpg

Some of those were gifted by well-meaning friends. Some of them were books I bought on an impulse. Then there were books that I had waited years to read only to find them unworthy of all those years of patience. But this book by Yuval Noah Harari tops the list. Just imagine reading a book that all your friends were going gaga about, only to find that there is nothing worthwhile in it and wondering whether you are really a good reader at all, now that you don’t even like a book that the whole world around you seems to love!\n\nLet’s clear a few things first, before you think of bashing me up. This is a commendable effort by Mr. Harari to summarize the whole history of mankind and its evolutionary tale. During the initial pages, I too thought that this will be one of the best reads on anthropology. But this book promises a lot only to deceive. We statisticians use the term confirmation bias, which means the tendency to favor and present only those information that are supportive to one’s beliefs. This book is full of them. Harari had decided to present all that is wicked and weak about Homo Sapiens and he has succeeded to a large extent.\n\nNot that I am complaining. I for one have never held the notion that we humans are special beings sitting atop the food chain, placed there by a favorable god who created us all in his (or, is it a ‘her’?) own image. I think of us as a different species of apes that managed to evolve a little quicker than our cousins. Despite our use of advanced languages, costly clothes and snazzy gadgets, internally we remain the beasts that roamed the vast forests once. I see nothing special about being human. This book helped cement that belief in my mind by discussing the idiocies and idiosyncrasies of our species as a whole.\n\nBut that’s just about it. This book isn’t ‘a brief history of humankind’, but the opinions of Mr. Harari about the various aspects of human evolution. This isn’t a chronological history in the lines of ‘What on Earth Happened?’ by Christopher Lloyd or ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’ by Bill Bryson, both of which I found to be far more informative and interesting than this one. This is both a philosophical take and passing of judgments by Mr. Harari on what he considers to be the vital cogs of human evolution, namely Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution &amp; Scientific Revolution. There is nothing that you end up learning that you already didn’t learn, especially in case you had read those two aforementioned books.\n\nSorry, dear friends.

The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.\n\nAnother area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review\n\nThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThat said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.\n\nIn low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThe smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.\n\nComing to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.\n\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review\n\nGalaxy M31\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.\n\nOn the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MJ5tDk4OL._SY88.jpg,3,worth for every penny,"\ n let 's start with the first strong point of the samsung galaxy m31 , the design . the phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000 mah battery . the phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand , though the one-handed operation is not that great . the sides are slightly curved , which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach . the phone is available in two colour options , ocean blue and space black . we got the latter for review and it sure looks premium , though it picks up fingerprints and smudges , so putting in a case is the best option . \ n \ nanother area where the galaxy m31 does a good job is the display . the smartphone is loaded with a 6 . 4- inch full hd + infinity u display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels . the display is protected with corning gorilla glass 3 protection . the display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing . furthermore , the phone supports widevine l1 support , meaning that you can stream hd content on netflix and amazon prime videos . \ n \ nsamsung galaxy m31 : camera review \ n \ nthe galaxy m31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras . the phone is loaded with a 64 -

megapixel selfie camera with f / 2 . 0 aperture . \ n \ ngalaxy m31 \ n \ nthat said , the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions . the photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed . the phone does a good job in taking macro shots , though you need to get used to it . the wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view , though detailing goes for a toss in this mode . the selfie performance is decent as well , though you might find some oversaturation in the photos . \ n \ nin low light conditions , the samsung galaxy m31 does an average job . in our testing , we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality . the details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image . the wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive . the night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using night mode in the camera , though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode . this some times spoils the whole composition , which can be frustrating at times . moving on , the live focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements . \ n \ nsamsung galaxy m31 : battery and security review \ n \ ngalaxy m31 \ n \ nthe smartphone is loaded with a 6,000 mah battery with 15w fast charging support . the major highlight of the galaxy m31 is the battery backup . in our testing , we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage . even if you do lots of gaming or stream content , the battery life will not disappoint you . coming to the charging speeds , the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent . \ n \ ncoming to the security , the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature . the fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone . furthermore , the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions , though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas . \ n \ nsamsung galaxy m31 : performance review \ n \ ngalaxy m31 \ n \ nthe samsung galaxy m31 is powered by a samsung exynos 9611 processor . this is the same chipset , which is found in galaxy a51 . the chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter . when it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone , it shows some sign of lag . in the gaming section , one can play casual games like subway surfers , johnny triggers and more without any lag , however , when it comes to high-end games like pubg mobile or asphalt series , the phone does a decent job as well . that said , you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions . \ n \ non the software front , the galaxy m31 runs on android 10 with company 's custom user interface oneui 2 . 0 running on top of it . the user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new dark mode , which is a good thing . apart from this , you get gesture-based navigation controls along with focus mode , digital wellbeing and parental controls . apart from this , you get some standard features like double-tap to wake , gesture-based screenshot and more . on the downside , you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including google and microsoft app suites along with other apps like netflix , facebook , samsung max and more . my galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day . \ n",2435.jpg

After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.\n\n*Camera:\n\nRear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.\nFront camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.\n\n* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.\n\n* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:\n--&gt; Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)\n--&gt; 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming\n--&gt; 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)\nDisclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.\n\n* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.\n\n* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.\n\n* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.\n\n* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).\n\n* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...\n--&gt; Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)\n--&gt; Personally love the Dark Mode.\n\nOverall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714y-Z3T93L._SY88.jpg,3,superb budget phone by samsung,"\ n purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i . e . 5th march 2020 ; 12:00 pm . after using more than a week , reviewing the phone on 14th march 2020 ; 5:15 pm . i hope you will find it helpful . \ n \ n * camera :\ n \ nrear camera has few mode / frames . out of which it 's fixed 3:4 ( 64 mp ) has great picture quality . other modes / frame like 3:4 , 9:16 , 1:1 , full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it . video quality is also good but could be better . \ nfront camera 32 mp is also fine . you will get delicately balanced picture quality . \ n \ n * 6 . 4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets . \ n \ n * battery ( 6000mah ): it stood on its ground . surely have high battery backup . did few experiments and here 's the result :\ n --> around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages ( wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running ) \ n --> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming \ n --> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi ( not sure for mobile network ) \ ndisclaimer : these hours may vary as per individual use and environment . i 'm sharing the details as per my own usage . \ n \ n * exynos 9611 octa core processor : samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor . the processor speed with the combination of android v10 is great . i did n't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games . the ram was n't even getting used completely . however , if we compare this processor with snapdragon , i can say that this processor is equivalent to snapdragon 700 series . \ n \ n * face unlock and fingerprint sensor : company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor . however , i did n't find that true . for face unlock , the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face . \ n \ n * phone comes with dual sim ( nano + nano ) facility but with dual standby . both sims are n't active simultaneously . \ n \ n * both charging slot and 3 . 5 mm jack for earphones are placed at same end ( bottom side ) , which i personally did n't like ( that is one of the reason i rate it 4 star ) . \ n \ n * there are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not . example : wifi calling support , blue light filter , smart view , ultra data saving mode , dulby atmos , dark mode etc . . . \ n --> dulby atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones ( i personally did n't find it that good . sound quality seems similar ) \ n --> personally love the dark mode . \ n \ noverall , the smartphone is great . if you want to purchase a smartphone within this range , you may go ahead with this one . \ n",2419.jpg

Excellent quality under 900rs,"\n Off late I ordered this pair of cycling shorts since I was a bit weary of the BTWIN shorts which I was using. These costed under 900rs which is a great price point for something this good in quality.\n\nWhat is Good:\n\n- The fit was excellent. Its a bit longer than traditional shorts. So it does grip the quads &amp; hams very well. Helps in longer rides - the added support &amp; compression.\n- The padding is very good. May not be Brevet grade but should be perfect for city rides. I have done 45-50km rides in this &amp; they held up pretty well. No fatigue whatsoever.\n- The Material is spandex based and breathes very well. Moisture wicking to say the least. The mesh material feels natural &amp; light on your skin.\n- The circumference around the thighs have this anti slip rubber lining which helps a lot to keep these in place. What is even better is that the rubber lining becomes more sticky as you sweat.\n- Feels natural to wear under a trouser or a pair of jeans. Please note, these will add a bit of bulk to your waist so if you wear a tight pair of jeans or trousers, it may become tight for comfort. But with an average pair of jeans, these are perfect to wear all day. There is a bit of bulge around the back which is to be expected given the padding. Yes- it is possible to wear it all day under jeans.\n- Quick dry material. So once I reach office, I take these off and drop em off on the bike to dry out. And I have noticed that these are dry within a hour or two.\n\nWhat could have been improved:\n\n- Sizing is very confusing. And I realized this after having to return &amp; reorder the product once. The sizing imagine should make it clear as to why. Asian Size is L but American Size is S while European size is M. For Indian, Asian size is the best reference. American size as always plus sizes.\n- This leads to the next point. I ordered Size M (Asian) which I exchanged for Size S (Asian). I usually wear size 32 jeans in Levis. Which means, anyone who has a slimmer waistline than 32 inches won't be able to get a size smaller than Size S. Since they dont have XS.\n\nNonetheless, these are great for everyday usage.\n\nOverall, this is a good product for the price. I use it for commuting to work everyday. So far, I have had not reason to complain - especially given the attractive price. And the padding is pretty great!\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HxL0Tc7QL._SY88.jpg,3,perfect cycling shorts to wear under jeans & trousers . excellent quality under 900rs,"\ n off late i ordered this pair of cycling shorts since i was a bit weary of the btwin shorts which i was using . these costed under 900rs which is a great price point for something this good in quality . \ n \ nwhat is good :\ n \ n - the fit was excellent . its a bit longer than traditional shorts . so it does grip the quads & hams very well . helps in longer rides - the added support & compression . \ n - the padding is very good . may not be brevet grade but should be perfect for city rides . i have done 45-50 km rides in this & they held up pretty well . no fatigue whatsoever . \ n - the material is spandex based and breathes very well . moisture wicking to say the least . the mesh material feels natural & light on your skin . \ n - the circumference around the thighs have this anti slip rubber lining which helps a lot to keep these in place . what is even better is that the rubber lining becomes more sticky as you sweat . \ n - feels natural to wear under a trouser or a pair of jeans . please note , these will add a bit of bulk to your waist so if you wear a tight pair of jeans or trousers , it may become tight for comfort . but with an average pair of jeans , these are perfect to wear all day . there is a bit of bulge around the back which is to be expected given the padding . yes - it is possible to wear it all day under jeans . \ n - quick dry material . so once i reach office , i take these off and drop em off on the bike to dry out . and i have noticed that these are dry within a hour or two . \ n \ nwhat could have been improved :\ n \ n - sizing is very confusing . and i realized this after having to return & reorder the product once . the sizing imagine should make it clear as to why . asian size is l but american size is s while european size is m . for indian , asian size is the best reference . american size as always plus sizes . \ n - this leads to the next point . i ordered size m ( asian ) which i exchanged for size s ( asian ) . i usually wear size 32 jeans in levis . which means , anyone who has a slimmer waistline than 32 inches wo n't be able to get a size smaller than size s . since they dont have xs . \ n \ nnonetheless , these are great for everyday usage . \ n \ noverall , this is a good product for the price . i use it for commuting to work everyday . so far , i have had not reason to complain - especially given the attractive price . and the padding is pretty great ! \ n",1759.jpg

USB Type B is an older port and is replaced by mini usb 5 pin B which this mic would now come with. Mine was usb mini as mentioned and I was successfully able to register my product serial number with Logitech (Since Blue company is now acquired by Logitech). Even Blue Sherpa Companion app was able to find my mic with correct serial number. So relax it is original only.\nNow for the review part-\n1. Amazon packaging was pathetic the box was damaged, they sent me the box in a white amazon polythene instead of packing it inside a cardboard box. Not sure what happened here usually Amazon pack things nicely so I guess it was the seller (Bought it from prime seller). However luckily my mic was not damaged. (Touchwood)\n2. Talking about mic itself, it is simply amazing, It captures the lows, the mids and the highs perfectly without any problems.\n3. Noise cancellation is okay, not best for sure but very decent, live streaming should not be a problem at all and if you are using it for voice overs you can post process it in either audacity or premier pro to make it sound like a professional studio mic.\n4. The wire sent with the mic was black for some reason even though my mic was white but it still looks absolutely stunning sitting on your desk, clubs very well with the setup, definitely an eye catcher.\n5. Stand provided with it is sturdy and has nice rubber feet so it will not slip off easily and will hold it’s position.\n Overall a great mic even in 2020 for beginners and growing youtubers, definitely gives you a professional edge without putting a whole in your pocket. I bought it during covid so costed me around 5k but you should be able to find a good deal on this, though it’s still worth it at 5k considering the sound it’s amazing sound quality. Would have given 5 stars but had to cut 1 star for packaging.\n\nIf you’re looking for a condenser mic which is easy to setup and is bang for your buck, look no further and buy this. You will not regret.\n\nThanks for taking time out to read my review.

So as per Samsung warranty can be availed using the invoice, your SSD is covered with warranty as mentioned on Samsung website against the SSD model. If you don't have invoice then warranty will be given from the date of manufacturing.\nIf don't have high budget then you can go with affordable option like Kingston, as I am using them as well from long time. You won't feel any difference in day to day use, only difference you can see between high capacity SSDs (like 1TB or 2TB) and smaller size SSDs (like 120GB or 240GB), when you will be copying large files (i.e.,100GB). Higher capacity SSDs tend to have larger RAM (chache), due to which they can hold high speed copying (500MB/Sec or higher) for longer than smaller SSDs, because smaller SSD will have small amount of RAM (chache).

We share planet Earth with so many diverse animal &amp; plant species, but no other species has changed this planet to the extent we humans have. I always wondered why humans? Why us?\nI got my answers in ‘Sapiens’. A brilliantly written masterpiece by Dr Yuval Noah Harari on history of humankind. Dr Harari has very elaborately explained why Homo Sapiens are different. What has propelled this one species from being just another life form to becoming the most dominant biological entity on Earth? Dr Harari says what distinguishes Homo Sapiens from others is our ability to believe in imagined entities. This enables us to cooperate in large groups.\n“Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination”\nHomo Deus on the other hand talks about future of Homo Sapiens. The future that author has talked about can be a wonder ride, scary, shocking for you depending on how you look at it. If you have already read Sapiens you will feel the Homo Deus being repetitive. Author has devoted significant portion talking about why Homo Sapiens have been successful till now. Most of the key challenges Homo Sapiens faced till 20th century have already been resolved. But will we remain satisfied just because we resolved challenges we have been facing till now? Author says ‘No’\n“We do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence.

Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.\n\nCons:\n1.

Keyboard: 9/10, Mouse: 7/10, read to know why","\n The first impressions of both the keyboard and the mouse were awesome! I needed these for programming as well as gaming. Here's a more detailed overview on the products:\n\n1) Keyboard\n\nQuality (9/10): The top panel is completely metal built, which gives a really premium feeling to it. The keyboard is heavy enough to justify its quality.\n\nTyping experience (9/10): Really good. If you're coming from a regular keyboard then you're gonna love it. The keys are pressed softly and still gives good haptic feedback. It's a great gaming keyboard too, because if you need to press the same keys multiple times quickly, the keyup timing is really snappy which gives you an edge over regular or other gaming keyboards. Of course, the typing experience is not as great as fully functional mechanical keyboards but then, for the price, it's no less either.\n\nLooks (10/10): The keyboard looks super ergonomic, thanks to its metallic design, stylish edges, cuts and RGB lights. There is a set of 3 RGB lights combinations, you can switch among them using the dedicated light key. It also allows you to turn them off in case you don't want them on (during the day?).\n\n2) Mouse\n\nQuality (7/10): I don't know what's wrong with the mouse but the build quality somehow feels cheaper than the keyboard. I've used a Dragonwar mouse before (ELE-G9) and the quality was much better comparatively. However, the mouse is highy responsive and performs really well.\n\nExperience (8/10): The primary button clicks work amazingly well. There are 2 additional keys at the left side which can be used as 'Forward' and 'Backward' buttons. These buttons come really handy while browsing the web as you don't need to move your mouse to the navigation bar of your web browser to navigate. I feel the buttons are a little misplaced though, The 'Forward' button is okay, but to click on the 'Backward' button, I need to move my thumb a bit towards the palm. This wouldn't be the issue if the buttons were placed a little more towards the primary buttons. The fifth button helps in changing the DPI, and it works, serves the purpose just right.\n\nPrice for money?\nAbsolutely. I bought it for 1200, the price is of course higher than it's normal SP, but then it's expected to be so because of the current situations. Even if I'm not counting much on the mouse for durability, the keyboard alone justifies the price to be honest.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N+pq82pxL._SY88.jpg,3,"worth the bucks ! keyboard : 9/10 , mouse : 7/10 , read to know why","\ n the first impressions of both the keyboard and the mouse were awesome ! i needed these for programming as well as gaming . here 's a more detailed overview on the products :\ n \ n1 ) keyboard \ n \ nquality ( 9/10 ): the top panel is completely metal built , which gives a really premium feeling to it . the keyboard is heavy enough to justify its quality . \ n \ ntyping experience ( 9/10 ): really good . if you 're coming from a regular keyboard then you 're gonna love it . the keys are pressed softly and still gives good haptic feedback . it 's a great gaming keyboard too , because if you need to press the same keys multiple times quickly , the keyup timing is really snappy which gives you an edge over regular or other gaming keyboards . of course , the typing experience is not as great as fully functional mechanical keyboards but then , for the price , it 's no less either . \ n \ nlooks ( 10/10 ): the keyboard looks super ergonomic , thanks to its metallic design , stylish edges , cuts and rgb lights . there is a set of 3 rgb lights combinations , you can switch among them using the dedicated light key . it also allows you to turn them off in case you do n't want them on ( during the day ? ) . \ n \ n2 ) mouse \ n \ nquality ( 7/10 ): i do n't know what 's wrong with the mouse but the build quality somehow feels cheaper than the keyboard . i 've used a dragonwar mouse before ( ele-g 9 ) and the quality was much better comparatively . however , the mouse is highy responsive and performs really well . \ n \ nexperience (8 / 10 ): the primary button clicks work amazingly well . there are 2 additional keys at the left side which can be used as ' forward ' and ' backward ' buttons . these buttons come really handy while browsing the web as you do n't need to move your mouse to the navigation bar of your web browser to navigate . i feel the buttons are a little misplaced though , the ' forward ' button is okay , but to click on the ' backward ' button , i need to move my thumb a bit towards the palm . this would n't be the issue if the buttons were placed a little more towards the primary buttons . the fifth button helps in changing the dpi , and it works , serves the purpose just right . \ n \ nprice for money ? \ nabsolutely . i bought it for 1200 , the price is of course higher than it 's normal sp , but then it 's expected to be so because of the current situations . even if i 'm not counting much on the mouse for durability , the keyboard alone justifies the price to be honest . \ n",3010.jpg

As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:\nPros:\nA great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]\nThe best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]\nSomewhere between great to excellent battery life\nThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDIC\nThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.\n\nCons:\nMany buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.\nYou will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.\nThe display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.\nAnd also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.\n\nConclusion with personal thoughts:\nOverall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.\n",1,sadness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AQCZRVGXL._SY88.jpg,4,overall a great phone just not a perfect one .,"\ n my mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try ios . as she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones [ previously lava red 5t ] i thought of advising her to go for iphone 11 . now coming to the phone or should i say iphone , it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties ; i 'll just list out a few points regarding the phone :\ npros :\ na great camera with realistic colors [ not highly saturated ] \ nthe best video recording on a mobile [ as of feb 2020 ] \ nsomewhere between great to excellent battery life \ nthe software experience is great if you 're into "" apple way "" of things and the whole experience is just fluidic \ nthe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it 's sides are alluminium and not steel . \ n \ ncons :\ nmany buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but i dont want to sugarcoat things ! the display is decent and not great ! in day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference , that is correct , but when you get into media apps like youtube , netflix , . . . etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution . there 's just no escaping that fact . \ nyou will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text . \ nthe display , in my opinion , would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she 's not a tech geek and she 's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone . \ nand also if you 're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop [ windows laptop ] this phone will frustrate you for sure . for this i will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process . \ n \ nconclusion with personal thoughts :\ noverall the phone is a great one if you 're not a tech geek and want the latest iphone . it 's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart tv . \ n",2107.jpg

I mean just take a moment and observe it, the perfect shade of blue with white flowers. Simplicity at its best. This book has some sort of vibe, I still remember how I smiled when I opened the amazon parcel and found this bundle of positivity and happiness. The sheer pleasure of caressing its pages which is very different as compared to the regular pages of other novels, it gives you immense relief Idk how and why, but it does. Coming to the main content, the book starts by telling the meaning of Ikigai i.e.,purpose of your life, reason to get out of your bed every morning happily and how finding your Ikigai will lead to a long and happy life. The importance of society and a friendly neighbourhood is well put.The interviews of the Japanese Centenarians explains why they are the longest living human beings on this planet, they do the simple activities like gardening also with full enthusiasm, they aren’t spending their retirement resting on an arm chair instead they attend Karaoke nights, indulge in group activities, sell their produce in vegetable market and believe in eating simple and exercising.They live in present and enjoy every moment happily. Because being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present and those who surround us.'\n🦋\nOur Ikigai is different for all of us but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning. There is no perfect strategy of connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it. Like the author said “Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you”. The simplest things are often the most beautiful, and this book is the perfect example of this statement. ' Eat right, exercise, and do what makes you happy'...by following this motto, we can definitely find our 'ikagai', our reason to live.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714nlI84ZKL._SY88.jpg,3,the best things in life are simple !,"\ n to be completely honest i bought this book just because of its cover . i mean just take a moment and observe it , the perfect shade of blue with white flowers . simplicity at its best . this book has some sort of vibe , i still remember how i smiled when i opened the amazon parcel and found this bundle of positivity and happiness . the sheer pleasure of caressing its pages which is very different as compared to the regular pages of other novels , it gives you immense relief idk how and why , but it does . coming to the main content , the book starts by telling the meaning of ikigai i . e . , purpose of your life , reason to get out of your bed every morning happily and how finding your ikigai will lead to a long and happy life . the importance of society and a friendly neighbourhood is well put . the interviews of the japanese centenarians explains why they are the longest living human beings on this planet , they do the simple activities like gardening also with full enthusiasm , they are n't spending their retirement resting on an arm chair instead they attend karaoke nights , indulge in group activities , sell their produce in vegetable market and believe in eating simple and exercising . they live in present and enjoy every moment happily . because being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad ; it should help us love the present and those who surround us .

I had bought this one to use it upstairs. It can be described as just a Chinese one branded in their name. Such a flimsy structure. The motor of supposed 1200w delivers a quarter of its power only. This one is just 8 months old and is DEAD now. I have booked a service and as usual there is no response from anyone.\n\nYou can know the company's attitude from certain things.\n● They don't disclose their service center's location or phone. The only access is their customer-care which is a premium charged number. Whenever you call the customer-care, you get the so-called parroting message. They don't want anyone to contact them. Any other company, you can take the product to their service centre at your convenient time and pick it up back the same. Here, you have to wait for the technician any time any day for 1 or 2 months.\n● There are three stages of escalation. Believe me, the third stage is a ""Eureka Forbes Ombudsman"". But none of the web forms work. In this new age, they require the customers to download, print and fill-up the form and send it by ordinary post. See the attitude.\n● They always confuse you using the words direct channel, indirect, franchisee, agent, sub-agent, etc. One guy would come and sell you some product or AMC with proper invoice and another guy would tell you that it is not the correct route and would deny service.\n● They deleted my comment on their facebook page detailing my complaint. Just read the comments on their Facebook and Twitter pages, and you'll know.\n\nEureka Forbes had a point years back when it was a monopoly in the market. I know, in my childhood, the executive would give a demo as if it had rocket science inside. The picture is changed. There are quality products with much advanced features at quite low prices. Never go for any Eureka Forbes product.

Ear comfort : fits too well. You won't need to adjust them once you've put them on.\n\nCons : apart from the normal shaped lead I didn't found any cons about it.

But the boot up time was around 2.5 minutes. Also I use Adobe softwares a lot (photoshop, Lightroom, premier Pro, After effect) and some of these softwares would take minutes to start. Now my laptop takes around 25 seconds to boot up (Yours could be less). Adobe Software's load time reduced to seconds.\n\nWho should buy this SSD?\n1. For beginners, who just want to give their PC a boost with a low budget.\n2. For older PC'S AND LAPTOPS. It's self explanatory.

Even top-class hardware will crawl if any of component is low grade which in my case its 5400rpm HDD. So i ordered SSD in the first place.\n\nSince, I earlier had 2.5"" SATA SSD in my XPS laptop, which was an upgrade to 7200 RPM SATA HDD, it was impossible for me to continue with HDD only config in this new Inspiron as it was laggy everywhere with huge boot time, app open time, slow interface, etc. It's like, once you get used to SSD, you just can't accept HDD in any case. :D\n\nGot it from Amazon @3599 during prime days. Normally it's available for 5k approx with MRP of 7999. A few years ago got the same SSD (EVO 850) in 2.5"" form factor for double the price ~8.5k. Technology &amp; price have interesting relationships. :D\n\n•••••••••\nINBOX\n•••••••••\n\n1. Solid State Drive\n2. Warranty &amp; Installation Guide\n3. Samsung Magician Software Leaflet\n\n••••••••\nPROS\n••••••••\n\n1. Highly reliable SSD by Samsung.\n2. As expected, the performance boost is great.\n3. Drive has great read/write speeds as per industrial standards.\n3. 512MB DRAM cache for performance improvement. Many SSD manufacturers skip this cache.\n4. It comes with 5 years warranty or 150 TBW.\n\n••••••••\nCONS\n••••••••\n\n1. Doesn't come with mounting screw. But that's the case with all. Many laptops will already have it in place.\n2. No heatsink provided. But again, the same is the case with all.\n\n▶ Samsung is a pioneer in this department of SSD and its EVO series is distinguishable by its name only, but still, they can provide certain addon things mentioned above to further kill the competition.\n\n▶ These cons affect initial setup and long term performance. 1 star deducted for that. So a ★★★★ star device.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••\nINSTALLATION\n••••••••••••••••••••\n\n→ I went on opening up all-new Inspiron 5580 to reveal the internals (following official guide by Dell available at support page) &amp; install Samsung 860 EVO M2 SSD. But a surprise was waiting inside to spoil my plans.\n\n→ There was no SSD screw mount &amp; screw inside. I contacted Dell customer care, hardware support, authorized seller/service center, local hardware shops, etc &amp; spent hours over the phone but without any luck. So had to settle with the double-sided tape, which in fact is quite risky. But so far its working good. I'll have some better custom screw mount arrangement in near future to secure SSD.\n\n→ In general, most of the laptops won't require any mount for SSD. Only a screw will suffice to secure it in place.\n\n→ As expected, there's huge performance improvement everywhere, super-fast boot time, snappy interface, faster apps, games, etc. In short beast mode is now active.\n\nNOTE\n\n▶ Installation instructions vary from model to model &amp; manufacturer to manufacturer. So, it can't be detailed here. To know about that, just head to the support page of your laptop manufacturer to find an official guide or perform a general search for disassembly instructions of your model. You will definitely find some text or video guide to do it.\n\n▶ Remember to use SSD as a primary OS drive, else your investment will be useless if you boot using HDD only and use it as a parallel storage drive only.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nOS &amp; SOFTWARE SETUP\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nOnce you install SSD you have two options to either clone HDD to SSD or to fresh install OS. I personally prefer a fresh install as it refreshes everything.\n\nAs a general practice, you should format &amp; reinstall OS once every year to refresh it &amp; to remove junk built up over time. You can always feel the difference after a fresh install. Also if you have recently upgraded your OS, a format or reset is recommended to avoid a variety of incompatibility issues that may arise.\n\n1. Cloning can be done using any related software like Minitool Partition Wizard, EaseUS, Samsung Data Migration, etc. For this, you need to install SSD first and then clone the existing OS into SSD using the tool. After that, you need to make it the first boot device using Bios. You can easily find detailed guides for this task.\n\n2. Fresh install is very simple. Just install the drive in the slot, use USB drive or DVD to install OS into the SSD and change boot options to make SSD as a first boot device. Before fresh install, you have the option to change the mode to AHCI or RAID via BIOS. Choose as per your needs. Changing it later on breaks the already installed OS and you won't be able to boot into it.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nSCORES: HDD vs SSD\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\n→ 3D Mark 11: 3487 vs 3668\n→ PCMark 10: 2638 vs 3197\n→ PCMark 8: 3507 vs 3635\n→ Cinebench R20: 1151 vs 1175\n→ Read Speed: 134 MB/s vs 552 MB/s\n→ Write Speed: 123 MB/s vs 530 MB/s\n→ Boot Time (post-OS selection screen to windows desktop): 40 s vs 4 s\n→ Shutdown Time: 45 s vs 10 s\n\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nSAMSUNG EVO 860 SATA vs WD GREEN SATA vs NVMe SSD\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nThere is this WD green available for half the price of Samsung SSD, but if it's cheaper, there's a reason for that. Remember a thumb rule, ""you get what you pay for"".\n\nSamsung SSD comes with 5 yrs warranty while WD comes with 3 years warranty. These drives have limited life span wrt terabytes written, but Samsung is confident enough wrt their quality to provide you a 5 yrs warranty. There're other hardware differences b/w both wrt built-in DRAM cache 512MB vs none, power consumption (2.2 W vs 2.8 W), controller, latency, technology, etc.\n\nIn all there's WD Green (SATA) for budget-oriented people, then Samsung EVO 860 (SATA) in medium-range to balance price-performance ratio, &amp; for extreme performance seekers there's Samsung EVO Series (NVMe). HDD to SSD (SATA) &amp; then to SSD (NVMe), performance &amp; price both increase.\n\nRead speed ratio is like- HDD : SSD (SATA) : SSD (NVMe) - 100:500:2000 MB/s.\nSo an obvious performance difference.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nSAMSUNG MAGICIAN\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nSamsung Magician is an interesting software that you can get officially. If performs a variety of tasks like auto firmware update, run performance benchmarks, run performance optimization, securely erase the disk, manage overprovisioning, manage rapid mode, etc.\n\nYou can always install it to avail above features and check the status of SSD in terms of condition, bytes written, etc.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nWARRANTY &amp; TBW THING\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nTBW or Terra Bytes Written is a term used by SSD manufacturers to assess how much data can be written to the SSD before it is likely to fail.\n\nEVO 860 comes with 150 TBW or 5 years warranty, whichever occurs earlier. You can monitor TBW in Magician software. Don't worry, 150 Terra Bytes is too much to be written to a hard disk and an average user is unlikely to shoot up this limit in 5 years or even 10 years.\n\nSo far, mine has 1.5 TBW in a matter of a month with medium usage (daily run time of 12-15 hours with browsing, blogging, video editing, gaming, etc). So it will have only 90 TBW by the end of 5 years at the current usage rate.\n\nYou can reduce TBW with few tweaks and restricting SSD to only critical things eg installing non-critical software to HDD, moving hibernation file to HDD in case if you use hibernation a lot, etc. Paging file also contributes a lot to TBW but it's not recommended to move it to HDD as it will hamper performance a lot.\n\n•••••••••••\nVERDICT\n•••••••••••\n\n▶ Samsung EVO ss a nice buy in this price range, balancing price to quality &amp; performance ratio. If you want the best of both worlds, then this is the thing you should get. (Read/Write speeds approx 550/530 MB/s)\n\n▶ If on a tight budget, but want to have SSD goodness, go get WD Green for half the price of Samsung EVO 860 SATA SSD. You will still have huge performance differences visible across the OS if coming from regular HDD. (Read/Write speeds approx 100/80 MB/s to 500/450 MB/s)\n\n▶ If you can extend your budget further &amp; your laptop supports NVMe standard on M2 slot, get NVMe SSD instead of SATA, say Samsung 960 EVO. (Read/Write speeds approx 3200/1900 MB/s)\n\n▶ If budget is not a concern to you and you just want the best of it, without any doubt get Samsung 960 Pro. (Read/Write speeds approx 3500/2100 MB/s)\n\nOverall, getting SSD is recommended for obvious reasons. If not NVMe SSD, at least get a SATA SSD (be it WD Green or Samsung EVO, as per your budget) and unleash the hidden beast inside your rig.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IlDMCuBsL._SY88.jpg,3,"ssd , a must for any computer | install & witness huge performance boost | review | guide |

According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I’ve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features.\n One of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‘picture in Picture’ in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking.\n Apple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing.\n Iphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone.\n Along with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing “continuity feature” that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier.\n Being a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but, my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available.\n",0,sadness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VwBeNuPuL._SY88.jpg,4,iphone 11

But I wont lie like 10x speed,"\n I rated 5 stars. This shows I am satisfied with the product. However I like to write few things here being an Video editor and Designer.\nBefore 2 years i purchased Dell Inspiron 15 5000 series laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz 2.70 GHz 8gb ram. After an year I added another 8gb ram. Things helped a little while working with premiere pro or photoshop. Still lightroom took massive 30 or 40 seconds to load. Also Premiere got hanged for 3-5 seconds many times during color grading (not crash). Also crashed many times while working on text layers. Now after 2.5 hard years I just replaced inbuilt 2 TB HDD with this newly bought 1TB Samsung 860 EVO. Now let me write the differences happened.\n\nPros:\nBoot time just 5 -8 seconds. Installed 2021 version of Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Blender 3D, After effects, etc., Lightroom opens so quickly now which is a masiive surprise. Premiere pro no hang at all. However windows crashed 3 times which i assume as software issue. Photoshop 2021 also comfortable to open and work when premiere pro is rendering a HD video file. File transfer speed inside different drives is 100-150mbps normally (practially 100-150 not 300-400mbps). After this SSD purchase honestly I admit my tensions were reduced so much while working on video editing. with 10K investment, I would say this is also a Health Investment for me (lol) as I am free now of from unwanted tensions.\n\nCons:\nCons is really not a cons at all. Just want to remind some facts and say don't over expect everything on this SSD alone. Recently i transfered 8 tb of files from different external hard disks. Some i copied to system and moved. Others were USB 3.0 to USB 2.0 and 1 significantly 128gb SSD. Here comes my point. SSD to SSD means it must be top speed. Right?\nI copied 30 gb from system to 128 gb sandisk SSD. for this I used Sata to USB 2.0 cable as thats what I had. The average transfer speed was just 37 mbps. Though I still take the blame on USB 2.0 cable, things like this happens. Some peoples just blame their PC SSD blindly.

Excellent camera and battery for this price.,"\n I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.\nMy first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.\nThe rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.\nPlayed pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.\nSo here are the pros and cons\nPROS:\n- Price\n- Camera\n- Battery\n- Display\n- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.\n\nCONS:\n- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.\n- Charging could be faster\n\nFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone.

Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained even in bright sunlight you see the display pretty well. The viewing angles are also good. No color changes when views angles gets changed. No queries from my side.\n\n2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla Glass 3 protection at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared to other phones of this budget section( of course thanks to massive battery).\n\n3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.\n\n4. Front Camera: Performed well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed texture on the face(just turn off the Beauty effect) and the one of the main function is that during calls, front camera is used as ambient light sensor to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's all about the habbit that is to be developed with time.\n\n5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played musics of high frequency and bass, at high sound it losses it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.\nThe ear piece sound quality is exceptionally great.\n\n6. Rear Cameras: The design of Quad Cameras impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.\n\nThe 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice the overall quality of normal 16MP photos are a bit rich as compared to 64MP photos as capturing image in 64MP and rendering it to 16MP increases it's quality.\n\nThe Live Focus is impressive and the blurring edge of the photos is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial lighting. I am satisfied very well.\n\nThe wide camera Performed pretty well and got satisfactory results.\n\nI am bit disappointed with the Macro Lens that didn't performed well, however in multiple shots I got a good quality macro photo. But using main camera for macro photos gives great results.\n\nThe LED was pretty good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally well.\n\n7. Battery: Yes the massive 6000mAH battery is worth called massive. I got the screen-on period of 10hours in a single charge. On using it in a average way gave me around 30 hours of backup.\n\n8. Performance: I experienced buttery smooth performance in using it in above average usage. But I will say that you can get a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance as it doesn't got a gaming processor.\nBut in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.\n\nThe only visible difference between M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement of secondary mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which is on the right in M30s\n\nAs a average user 60Hz display is okay for me, I didn't experienced any frame drops.\n\nOverall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.\n\nI will reccomend this product for average users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.\n",0,sadness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61By+B978CL._SY88.jpg,4,a good value of money and feature loaded product .,"\ n the box contents :\ nthe phone , charger ( 15w ) , c-type charging-cum-usb cable , some related papers \ n \ nfirst impressions :\ nthe package was packed well and the samsung box was compact . \ nthe phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed . \ n \ nafter a week usuge :\ n1 . display : as the specification refers , it is samoled . the brightness is well maintained even in bright sunlight you see the display pretty well . the viewing angles are also good . no color changes when views angles gets changed . no queries from my side . \ n \ n2 . body : the body is plastic back built with gorilla glass 3 protection at the front , the body felt a bit heavy as compared to other phones of this budget section ( of course thanks to massive battery ) . \ n \ n3 . sim tray : the sim tray has the 2 + 1 sim and microsd slot . \ n \ n4 . front camera : performed well in natural as well artificial lighting . can see the detailed texture on the face ( just turn off the beauty effect ) and the one of the main function is that during calls , front camera is used as ambient light sensor to turn off the screen . some may find this not helpful it 's all about the habbit that is to be developed with time . \ n \ n5 . speakers : single speaker at the bottom right . i played musics of high frequency and bass , at high sound it losses it quality a bit but yes at 70-80 % volume the sound was good and satisfying . \ nthe ear piece sound quality is exceptionally great . \ n \ n6 . rear cameras : the design of quad cameras impressed me , on the top left it got a 5mp sensor and below that we got a 64mp main camera module and below that we have a 8mp wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8mp wide angle-lens and below it we got a single led flash . \ n \ nthe 64mp images are out the box . but you will notice the overall quality of normal 16mp photos are a bit rich as compared to 64mp photos as capturing image in 64mp and rendering it to 16mp increases it 's quality . \ n \ nthe live focus is impressive and the blurring edge of the photos is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial lighting . i am satisfied very well . \ n \ nthe wide camera performed pretty well and got satisfactory results . \ n \ ni am bit disappointed with the macro lens that did n't performed well , however in multiple shots i got a good quality macro photo . but using main camera for macro photos gives great results . \ n \ nthe led was pretty good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares , when it has a 64mp camera with night mode . yes the night mode is exceptionally well . \ n \ n7 . battery : yes the massive 6000mah battery is worth called massive . i got the screen-on period of 10hours in a single charge . on using it in a average way gave me around 30 hours of backup . \ n \ n8 . performance : i experienced buttery smooth performance in using it in above average usage . but i will say that you can get a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games . yeah , you will not get that performance as it does n't got a gaming processor . \ nbut in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag . \ n \ nthe only visible difference between m30s and m31 is that the camera module area is 2mm wider in m31 and the placement of secondary mic . is in top left in case of m31 and which is on the right in m30s \ n \ nas a average user 60hz display is okay for me , i did n't experienced any frame drops . \ n \ noverall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating , frame drops at high settings . \ n \ ni will reccomend this product for average users . this phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good ai in camera . it is good for photography and this 6gb / 128gb black version is just out of the box . \ n",2472.jpg

Exynos processor dissapoints,"\n It's a great phone to buy on Big sales or Deep discount sales days. The phone is definitely worth buying for 14k or less but not beyond that. The Exynos processor is what made me think twice. Would have beeen great if they had SD processor. Nontheless Exynos does a decent job but definitely nowhere near Qualcomm SD.\n\nPros\n* Amoled - Display is pretty good\n* Camera - Camera is extremely good for a phone priced at 14k\n* Sound - Not that clear/sharp while attending calls but Ok, not bad either\n* Battery - super good.. lasts 1 day on heavy use and 1.5days for normal use\n\ncons\n* Processor - Exynos instead of SD\n* Battery charging - says fast charging but takes at least 2.5 hours for full charge\n* Packaging - No laminated one time use screen protector (the laminated kind of sheet) is provided. Tempered glass has to be put immediately after receiving to prevent unnecessary scratches or damages.\n* Silicon Cover - it would hardly cost 10/- or 20/- for the manufacturer, they should have provided a basic mobile cover\n* Audio - not that great even with Samsung headphones..listening to music won't be a great experience even if you enable dolby or whatever the feature it has got\n* Screen size - 6.7 inches would have been better\n* Bloatware - Too many bloatware..unnecessary and annoying\n\nOverall - It does a pretty good job. For 14k or below, just go for it..\n\nafter 3months of usage:\nPhone is good, got android 11 update as well..\nfew annoying things to be noted are\n1) during calls, the hold or record button gets enabled when the ear touches the sides of the pannels. I couldn't find a way to disable this on call menu. What I do is, put the phone into home screen and lock the screen as soon as I attend the call or when my calls gets picked\n\n2) Bloatware - Too many bloatwares and Galaxy store updates apps of its liking. So I disbaled Galaxy store\n\n3) Power cord - the length of the cord is way less than cords provided by any other brands. Apart from cutting cost by providing an inferior Exynos processor samsung wanna cut cost by cutting the cord's length.\n\n4) Exynos is no where near SD\n",1,disgust,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BnIiVdc0L._SY88.jpg,1,a decent phone if you buy on deep discount days . exynos processor dissapoints,"\ n it 's a great phone to buy on big sales or deep discount sales days . the phone is definitely worth buying for 14k or less but not beyond that . the exynos processor is what made me think twice . would have beeen great if they had sd processor . nontheless exynos does a decent job but definitely nowhere near qualcomm sd . \ n \ npros \ n * amoled - display is pretty good \ n * camera - camera is extremely good for a phone priced at 14k \ n * sound - not that clear / sharp while attending calls but ok , not bad either \ n * battery - super good . . lasts 1 day on heavy use and 1 . 5 days for normal use \ n \ ncons \ n * processor - exynos instead of sd \ n * battery charging - says fast charging but takes at least 2 . 5 hours for full charge \ n * packaging - no laminated one time use screen protector ( the laminated kind of sheet ) is provided . tempered glass has to be put immediately after receiving to prevent unnecessary scratches or damages . \ n * silicon cover - it would hardly cost 10 / - or 20 / - for the manufacturer , they should have provided a basic mobile cover \ n * audio - not that great even with samsung headphones . . listening to music wo n't be a great experience even if you enable dolby or whatever the feature it has got \ n * screen size - 6 . 7 inches would have been better \ n * bloatware - too many bloatware . . unnecessary and annoying \ n \ noverall - it does a pretty good job . for 14k or below , just go for it . . \ n \ nafter 3months of usage :\ nphone is good , got android 11 update as well . . \ nfew annoying things to be noted are \ n1 ) during calls , the hold or record button gets enabled when the ear touches the sides of the pannels . i could n't find a way to disable this on call menu . what i do is , put the phone into home screen and lock the screen as soon as i attend the call or when my calls gets picked \ n \ n2 ) bloatware - too many bloatwares and galaxy store updates apps of its liking . so i disbaled galaxy store \ n \ n3 ) power cord - the length of the cord is way less than cords provided by any other brands . apart from cutting cost by providing an inferior exynos processor samsung wanna cut cost by cutting the cord 's length . \ n \ n4 ) exynos is no where near sd \ n",2438.jpg

I bought redgear cloak in September 2019 for ₹899. Its a very good headphones no doubt but but but , every coins has its down sides. So first let me share my good experience about these headphones. I mainly bought it for gaming like pubg , cod , minecraft etc. The build quality for 900 rs headphones is much much better than most of other existing headphones in the market. The quality of RGB is amazing but the effects are random you can't control RGB. Another good thing is you got a volume controller on headphones itself. it's also got a 3D sound effect. Now let's talk about the downside , the sound quality : the sound quality isn't best enough its just average + my headphone's right side driver was producing very low sound volume which is very annoying. Secondly you need a Audio + mic splitter for using it on mobile which cost you extra bucks. The last thing i faced with this issue is its Audio jack stopped working after almost 7 months of use and i didn't get the replacement yet because of the ongoing lockdown. Hope redwood interactive will replace my unit as it is under 1 year warranty. After my opinion headphone is about okay okay and I'm rating 3 stars for it.\nPros\n1. Beast build quality.\n2. Aggressive pricing.\n3. Damn good RGB.\n4. Eardrum cushioning.\n5. Auto adjustable headband.\n\nCons\n1. Low quality audio jack.\n2. Unbalanced volume.\n3. No 3.5 mm jack.\n4. Too big for small ears.\n5.

What that essentially means is that there's nothing better than the M50x under ₹20k. The better beyerdynamic ones are more expensive than 20k. Just friggin get it. I don't think with the increased price of the M40x (at the time of writing the review it's selling for about 9k) the M40x is a good value anymore. Also, get the brainwavz sheepskin pads. Stock pads are trash. Skip to the end for the scores.\nSidenote, amazon really ruined the packaging in the delivery process. On top of that, it was just lying there in the so-called “final destination” hub that’s like 5km from my home for 4 days. The amazon packaging as well as the M50x box got absolutely wet and wrecked. Really disappointed, Amazon (it was Amazon Transportation Services, mind you). This however is also a testament to the built quality of the headphones as they were in perfect condition despite the heavy beating the packaging received, and hence won’t be returning them. I just don’t have the time to wait another month for amazon to replace the thing. I need to get my work done.\n\nSOUND\n\nAlright down to business now. If accurate is the word you're looking for, you've come to the right place. The M50x has excellent reproduction and it's immensely revealing. More so than the M40x. The sound stage is wide for a closed back headphone. The major improvement over the M40x would be the excellent imaging which was quite mediocre in the M40x. Instrument separation is excellent as well. Even the most intricate producing trickeries that most headphones in this price point can’t even reproduce become crystal clear. If you’re upgrading from something cheaper or the dreaded skullcandy or beats headphones, you’ll be surprised how much you were missing out on. If frequency response graphs are anything to go by, M50x is supposed to be more flat compared to the M40x but to my ears, the M50x seem to have a very slight emphasis on the lows. I was surprised to see that Audio-Technica has done away with the foam sheets that they used to put in between the driver and the earpad and actually tweaked the driver design, which is a good thing. You don’t have to worry about the thin foam sheets while changing pads. Not having to rely on those is always a good thing. I didn’t notice any drastic change in the sound quality with the change in pads. Perhaps slightly better sound stage.\n\nBUILD AND COMFORT\n\n With the stock pads, the comfort isn’t anything to write home about. But it’s not bad. The pads are still pleather so they’ll last 2 years at most, though it does depend on how rough you use them. I already had the sheepskin pads from my M40x, which recently broke. Not the headphone’s fault. A certain person had borrowed them from me for a few days and he managed to break the thing somehow, at an age of 4 years. Rest in Peace, my dear M40x. Ah, right. The M50x. Excellent build quality, mediocre comfort with the stock pads. With almost any pad, it’ll get hot and sweaty during summers unless you’ve got everything air conditioned. The clamping force is a bit high but not uncomfortably so. It WILL loosen up a bit with time and become really comfortable. The folds and turns feel solid and the fold-in mechanism is satisfyingly clicky. The bottomline is I wouldn’t worry about it breaking on me unless I was a very rough user. If you’re one of those, you need some industrial construction equipment, not the M50x… or loads of cash to buy spare headphones. The top layer of the pleather does tend to wear off though, but it’s universally the case for all pleather. Not a big issue. Once it starts happening, just take half an hour to peel all of it off. The bare grey Velor kinda material looks way sleeker in my opinion.\n\nSCORES\n Sound: 9/10\n Comfort: 7/10, 9.5/10 with the pads replaced\n Build: 9/10\n Soundstage: 7/10\n Imaging: 9/10\n Separation: 10/10\n Sound isolation, passive: 7/10, 8/10 with the pads replaced.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Hm-xeXAtL._SY88.jpg,3,industry standard for a reason !,"\ n tldr \ n \ nbetter than the m40x for critical work in the sense that it is more revealing and arguably more accurate . what that essentially means is that there 's nothing better than the m50x under ₹ 20k . the better beyerdynamic ones are more expensive than 20k . just friggin get it . i do n't think with the increased price of the m40x ( at the time of writing the review it 's selling for about 9k ) the m40x is a good value anymore . also , get the brainwavz sheepskin pads . stock pads are trash . skip to the end for the scores . \ nsidenote , amazon really ruined the packaging in the delivery process . on top of that , it was just lying there in the so-called “ final destination ” hub that 's like 5km from my home for 4 days . the amazon packaging as well as the m50x box got absolutely wet and wrecked . really disappointed , amazon ( it was amazon transportation services , mind you ) . this however is also a testament to the built quality of the headphones as they were in perfect condition despite the heavy beating the packaging received , and hence wo n't be returning them . i just do n't have the time to wait another month for amazon to replace the thing . i need to get my work done . \ n \ nsound \ n \ nalright down to business now . if accurate is the word you 're looking for , you 've come to the right place . the m50x has excellent reproduction and it 's immensely revealing . more so than the m40x . the sound stage is wide for a closed back headphone . the major improvement over the m40x would be the excellent imaging which was quite mediocre in the m40x . instrument separation is excellent as well . even the most intricate producing trickeries that most headphones in this price point can't even reproduce become crystal clear . if you 're upgrading from something cheaper or the dreaded skullcandy or beats headphones , you 'll be surprised how much you were missing out on . if frequency response graphs are anything to go by , m50x is supposed to be more flat compared to the m40x but to my ears , the m50x seem to have a very slight emphasis on the lows . i was surprised to see that audio-technica has done away with the foam sheets that they used to put in between the driver and the earpad and actually tweaked the driver design , which is a good thing . you do n't have to worry about the thin foam sheets while changing pads . not having to rely on those is always a good thing . i did n't notice any drastic change in the sound quality with the change in pads . perhaps slightly better sound stage . \ n \ nbuild and comfort \ n \ n with the stock pads , the comfort is n't anything to write home about . but it 's not bad . the pads are still pleather so they 'll last 2 years at most , though it does depend on how rough you use them . i already had the sheepskin pads from my m40x , which recently broke . not the headphone 's fault . a certain person had borrowed them from me for a few days and he managed to break the thing somehow , at an age of 4 years . rest in peace , my dear m40x . ah , right . the m50x . excellent build quality , mediocre comfort with the stock pads . with almost any pad , it 'll get hot and sweaty during summers unless you 've got everything air conditioned . the clamping force is a bit high but not uncomfortably so . it will loosen up a bit with time and become really comfortable . the folds and turns feel solid and the fold-in mechanism is satisfyingly clicky . the bottomline is i would n't worry about it breaking on me unless i was a very rough user . if you 're one of those , you need some industrial construction equipment , not the m50x . . . or loads of cash to buy spare headphones . the top layer of the pleather does tend to wear off though , but it 's universally the case for all pleather . not a big issue . once it starts happening , just take half an hour to peel all of it off . the bare grey velor kinda material looks way sleeker in my opinion . \ n \ nscores \ n sound : 9/10 \ n comfort : 7/10 , 9 . 5 / 10 with the pads replaced \ n build : 9/10 \ n soundstage : 7/10 \ n imaging : 9/10 \ n separation : 10/10 \ n sound isolation , passive : 7/10 , 8/ 10 with the pads replaced . \ n",2737.jpg

Go for it without any doubt.,"\n This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.\n\nGood:\n\n- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!\n- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.\n- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.\n- 6000 Mah battery is BIG\n- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.\n- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE\n- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.\n- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.\n- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.\n- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good\n- Received next day by 11 AM !\n\nNot So Good:\n\n- Not that thin, but ok.\n- Doesn't have Samsung Dex\n- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.\n- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue.

DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED,"\n Firstly, I have been using this earphones for about two months, and I haven't seen one single problem. The length is a little too long, but it's okay. Noise cancellation is just mind blowing. Even if you just put them on and not play anything also, you can't hear people talking around you. But if it's at full volume, even if battles are going on around you, you can't hear them(a little exaggeration, haha) If you are an extreme basshead, please go for boAt. The bass in this earphones is basically non existent, but hey, you don't buy JBL for the bass, but for the pure sound(which is wonderful, by the way) Even if you are a person who likes the Apple model of earphones, and not the shove in the ear type(like me), you won't find any problem with the comfort, thanks to the angled design. Finally, definitely buy this product, but wait until the price becomes 549 Indian rupees(about 7.45 US Dollars, 6.09 Euros) , because Amazon sometimes makes it 700 Indian Rupees(9.5 US Dollars, 7.78 Euros). Whatever type of person you are, you will find these earphones an absolute delight. I loved them, and I have given them a 5 star rating on everything except the bass.

We share planet Earth with so many diverse animal &amp; plant species, but no other species has changed this planet to the extent we humans have. I always wondered why humans? Why us?\nI got my answers in ‘Sapiens’. A brilliantly written masterpiece by Dr Yuval Noah Harari on history of humankind. Dr Harari has very elaborately explained why Homo Sapiens are different. What has propelled this one species from being just another life form to becoming the most dominant biological entity on Earth? Dr Harari says what distinguishes Homo Sapiens from others is our ability to believe in imagined entities. This enables us to cooperate in large groups.\n“Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination”\nHomo Deus on the other hand talks about future of Homo Sapiens. The future that author has talked about can be a wonder ride, scary, shocking for you depending on how you look at it. If you have already read Sapiens you will feel the Homo Deus being repetitive. Author has devoted significant portion talking about why Homo Sapiens have been successful till now. Most of the key challenges Homo Sapiens faced till 20th century have already been resolved. But will we remain satisfied just because we resolved challenges we have been facing till now? Author says ‘No’\n“We do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon” -Homo Deus\nIf you want to know what we will be up to I strongly recommend Homo Deus to you. I am sure you will be shocked to read all the possibilities that future holds for our kind.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612ryQ2jM4L._SY88.jpg,3,why you should read sapiens,"\ n the current corona pandemic has given us a lot of time to think about nature & how humankind has impacted it . we share planet earth with so many diverse animal & plant species , but no other species has changed this planet to the extent we humans have . i always wondered why humans ? why us ? \ ni got my answers in ‘ sapiens ' . a brilliantly written masterpiece by dr yuval noah harari on history of humankind . dr harari has very elaborately explained why homo sapiens are different . what has propelled this one species from being just another life form to becoming the most dominant biological entity on earth ? dr harari says what distinguishes homo sapiens from others is our ability to believe in imagined entities . this enables us to cooperate in large groups . \ n “ large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths . any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state , a medieval church , an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people 's collective imagination ” \ nhomo deus on the other hand talks about future of homo sapiens . the future that author has talked about can be a wonder ride , scary , shocking for you depending on how you look at it . if you have already read sapiens you will feel the homo deus being repetitive . author has devoted significant portion talking about why homo sapiens have been successful till now . most of the key challenges homo sapiens faced till 20th century have already been resolved . but will we remain satisfied just because we resolved challenges we have been facing till now ? author says ‘ no ' \ n “ we do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence . rather , we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations . the bad news is that as conditions improve , expectations balloon ” - homo deus \ nif you want to know what we will be up to i strongly recommend homo deus to you . i am sure you will be shocked to read all the possibilities that future holds for our kind . \ n",612.jpg

The seller is Appario Retail Private Ltd. Thank you guys! The price paid for 500 GB Samsung EVO SSD is Rs. 6999.\n\nOh!, and for the records this SSD s MADE IN CHINA.\n\nPreparations.\n***********\nTook stock of my current OS was genuine Windows 10 running that was upgraded from OEM installed Windows 8.1. Data was already backed up in an external HDD. My Microsoft account was already linked to Windows 10 product key.\nMy first attempt to Migrate Windows 10 to SSD alone using USB recovery disk failed. Though the BIOS recognized the SSD, somehow the OS recovery using USB recovery disk was never completed at the end. Tried almost all configurations I just did not wanted wait to buy a caddy tray and experiment for lack of time. So, the second method of fresh OS install seemed to be the workable option.\n(Later on, I found out by web searches why the recovery process did not work. The EVO SSD was already partitioned! That means the existing partitions should be removed to install Windows 10 properly).\n\nMethod that worked.\n***********************\n1. Removed the HDD and installed SSD in that place.\n2. Changed BIOS setting to boot from USB. SSD was already detected and shown in BIOS.\n3. Downloaded Media creation tool from Microsoft and created USB bootable disk (Need 16 GB minimum. I used a 32 GB Sandisk USB drive for safety)\n4. Boot from the newly created bootable Windows 10 - version 2020. remove all exiting partitions and used complete disk for OS. No manual partitioning.\n5. After various reboots competed, connected to internet. Let the OS installation complete.\n6. Log on to the freshly installed Windows 10 using my Microsoft account (To which the Windows 10 CD Key is linked)\n\nVoila! My revitalized, super-fast 'fresh' Laptop is ready with all the required bells and whistles!\n\nNotes.\n*******\n1. Samsung recommends 10% of your disk space should be allocated to overprovisioning.\n2. If you have enable RAPID mode ( Kind of using RAM for disk write operations , in order to speed up things, you will have to allocate around 1.5 GB of memory to this operations. Go for this only if you are a minimum of 8 GB memory. I have not used RAPID mode because I don't need to write anything huge to the disks.\n\nVerdict.\n********\nConsidering all other alternatives, I found it is better to upgrade the HDD to SSD and add more RAM to my 5 years old laptop is the best way of utilizing resources during this Covid 19 time. Upgrading to Samsung EVO SATA SSD perfectly helped me to achieve that goal. My laptop is pretty fast to boot and does not heats up like before. That, by itself a great improvement.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pTopvhxsL._SY88.jpg,3,hp pavilion 15 - ab035ax hdd - ssd migration ( genuine windows 10 ),"\ n wanted to replace the ailing hdd with ssd and lease a new life to my hp pavilion 15 - ab035ax \ nordered on 8 june 2020 and received on 12 june 2020 . the seller is appario retail private ltd . thank you guys ! the price paid for 500 gb samsung evo ssd is rs . 6999 . \ n \ noh ! , and for the records this ssd s made in china . \ n \ npreparations . \ n * * * \ ntook stock of my current os was genuine windows 10 running that was upgraded from oem installed windows 8 . 1 . data was already backed up in an external hdd . my microsoft account was already linked to windows 10 product key . \ nmy first attempt to migrate windows 10 to ssd alone using usb recovery disk failed . though the bios recognized the ssd , somehow the os recovery using usb recovery disk was never completed at the end . tried almost all configurations i just did not wanted wait to buy a caddy tray and experiment for lack of time . so , the second method of fresh os install seemed to be the workable option . \ n ( later on , i found out by web searches why the recovery process did not work . the evo ssd was already partitioned ! that means the existing partitions should be removed to install windows 10 properly ) . \ n \ nmethod that worked . \ n * * * \ n1 . removed the hdd and installed ssd in that place . \ n2 . changed bios setting to boot from usb . ssd was already detected and shown in bios . \ n3 . downloaded media creation tool from microsoft and created usb bootable disk ( need 16 gb minimum . i used a 32 gb sandisk usb drive for safety ) \ n4 . boot from the newly created bootable windows 10 - version 2020 . remove all exiting partitions and used complete disk for os . no manual partitioning . \ n5 . after various reboots competed , connected to internet . let the os installation complete . \ n6 . log on to the freshly installed windows 10 using my microsoft account ( to which the windows 10 cd key is linked ) \ n \ nvoila ! my revitalized , super-fast ' fresh ' laptop is ready with all the required bells and whistles ! \ n \ nnotes . \ n * * * \ n1 . samsung recommends 10 % of your disk space should be allocated to overprovisioning . \ n2 . if you have enable rapid mode ( kind of using ram for disk write operations , in order to speed up things , you will have to allocate around 1 . 5 gb of memory to this operations . go for this only if you are a minimum of 8 gb memory . i have not used rapid mode because i do n't need to write anything huge to the disks . \ n \ nverdict . \ n * * * \ nconsidering all other alternatives , i found it is better to upgrade the hdd to ssd and add more ram to my 5 years old laptop is the best way of utilizing resources during this covid 19 time . upgrading to samsung evo sata ssd perfectly helped me to achieve that goal . my laptop is pretty fast to boot and does not heats up like before . that , by itself a great improvement . \ n",3893.jpg

Hats off to Amazon! Packaging was great as usual from Amazon/Cloudtail.\n\nI have posted a comprehensive unboxing/review video on my YouTube channel. Please check that out for the mic test at this link -\n[...]\n\nI wanted an entry level/budget microphone for my YouTube videos. After going through reviews of the Blue Snowball, Samson Meteorite and Blue Snowball ICE, I decided to get this one. In the package you'll get the microphone, USB cable, tripod stand and a manual. The build quality is excellent and feels very premium. The microphone itself looks very cute and stylish. It feels very solid and sturdy in the hand.\n\nSetup is very simple. You just need to screw the tripod stand into the microphone and set it on the table. Plug the microphone into the laptop via the USB cable and the light on top of the microphone glows red. That's it! Its good to go! Its plug and play, so no drivers or software or application required. Go to Sound settings of your laptop and select the Snowball ICE as the recording device. You can then use any audio recording software (like Audacity) to record the audio. It takes power from the laptop and no separate power source required.\n\nThe Snowball ICE only has a cardioid/uni-directional mode for recording. So it'll pick up sound from any source directly in-front of it. The optimal distance between the sound source and the microphone should be around 8-12 inches. Moving farther away from the mic will reduce the intensity and up close you would hear your voice popping at the 'B's and 'P's.\n\nIf you're looking for a budget USB microphone for podcasts/YouTube videos/Skype calls, then look no further. I got it for Rs. 4399 as part of the festive season sale.

The M50x are amazingly good in showing you details which you've never heard in your favorite songs which you've listened to over hundreds of times..

The base always came out nice deep and punchy not overpowering in any manner and not for bass heads if you're thinking it pumps out sony xb kinda bass no it doesn't it gives you accurate bass reproduction that was meant to be heard without any effects... And yes these are amazing at that... Producing sound that was meant to be heard in that manner... Clear highs Mesmerizing mids and punchy bass.. Though out of the box it will not be as great but as time goes and the drivers get warmed up and adequately burned in the sound will slowly start to change towards betterment and will come out how it was supposed to be LEGENDARY. And if you want like really good base response from them for gym or to listen to edm and hard bass drop songs then i have an eq setting for that as well (photo attached) it will bring out that lovely basssssss with a few sacrifice in other tones but for edm its perfect (for me)...

And when I start any program or software then it took 10 min minimum to actual able to run. I see the the other components is very powerful but my hdd is very slow which is 5400 rpm. Then I think should I purchase new ssd m.2, hey guys first of all check the place where ssd m.2 is able to installed or not in your laptop. But notmally if you bought new laptop of current generation then off course 90% chance have it. But prior buy any type of ssd make sure to check ✔ whether it have m.2 or SATA port where your ssd fit into it.\nNow comming at my situation my notebook have m.2 port which is support new ssd of m.2 is look like RAM.\nThen I bought it and Fresh install new windows 10 Licensed. It is also very easy to fit in m.2 compartment. And you can fresh install windows into it. I would say to install Fresh windows because with fresh windows you are enjoy full performance of ssd. And if you want to migrant or clone from hdd then it only provide 70 to 80 % speed.

Now I haven't thrown away the old HDD, I just bought an enclosure to convert it to an external backup HDD which ensures the previous hardware doesn't become redundant.\n\nNow being a casual developer I have the complete Netbeans IDE, WAMp and Xampp servers installed along with Photoshop and Corel, add to that I keep on using Dockers, Containers and Kubernetesa few games like Sniper, NFS payback, the combination of the above are going to even kill the latest of the machines with an i7 under it's hood if you don't have an SSD. Now with the SSD on board this machine handles the stuff almost as good as a i7 laptop that I use for similar purposes. However gaming would still be a huge challenge as it depends primarily on the graphics card which renders great performance.\n\nThis investment has to be one of the best I haveade ever and people who still aren't willing to give up on their old buddy (machine's) with an investment as little as 10k you can significantly upgrade the specs and the performance.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bOrTWsMnL._SY88.jpg,3,a perfect upgrade for my 1 year old omen . .,"\ n the best in class ssd . \ n \ nplease note : this model does n't come with the msata to usb adapter neither does it have the screws for fitting . for the ones with the adapter buy a product of which the model number ends with rw . \ n \ nworks like a charm , read and write speeds are consistently around the 450-500 mbps bracket . \ n \ ni cloned my existing os to this one and it works like a charm . \ n \ nnow let 's talk about performance , i used this to upgrade my hp omen which has a i5 on board and since the upgrade the good old machine is giving a run for their money . and builds a strong case for people with an existing i5 machine to upgrade to an ssd . now i have n't thrown away the old hdd , i just bought an enclosure to convert it to an external backup hdd which ensures the previous hardware does n't become redundant . \ n \ nnow being a casual developer i have the complete netbeans ide , wamp and xampp servers installed along with photoshop and corel , add to that i keep on using dockers , containers and kubernetesa few games like sniper , nfs payback , the combination of the above are going to even kill the latest of the machines with an i7 under it 's hood if you do n't have an ssd . now with the ssd on board this machine handles the stuff almost as good as a i7 laptop that i use for similar purposes . however gaming would still be a huge challenge as it depends primarily on the graphics card which renders great performance . \ n \ nthis investment has to be one of the best i haveade ever and people who still are n't willing to give up on their old buddy ( machine 's ) with an investment as little as 10k you can significantly upgrade the specs and the performance . \ n",3880.jpg

Unfortunately there is no option to turn off noise cancellation.\n\nRecommendation:\nIf we want quality, I would suggest go for a good quality headset. It's voice would be clearer than this.\n\nCons:\n- Very harsh noise cancellation, which reduces quality of actual voice.\n- 20 feel cable is so long.

Alright let's move to pros and Cons...\n\nPros...\n1. Value for money.\n2. Looks great and is light weight.\n3. It's got both Android as well as Patchwall. And with a strong WiFi connection you won't need Cable or Dish antenna connection any more.\n4. For an average room the built in speakers are enough.\n5. Patch wall has a lot of free content to offer and when connected to your Android phone there is whole lot of possible things that you can do, being able to play Pub g on medium settings is my favourite.\n6. You can connect your pendrive to side load apps as well.\n7. trick: Side load thopp TV app to watch paid content for free.\n8. Voice command on Mi remote works as good as in any Android phone.\n\nCons..\n1. While the speakers are loud and clear with Android TV apps and Patchwall it somehow seems muffled up with Cable connection.\n2. Same applies with display. Normal SD connection cable picture quality is disappointing one needs an HD connection for better experience.\n3. WiFi range isnt very powerful had to shift my Mi WiFi router from Bedroom to Hall for a steady connection.\n",1,surprise,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716I8SBeb4L._SY88.jpg,5,"bang for bugs , read review for pros and cons","\ n got it for as low as 9k during sales with discounts . the amazon installation team did n't show up for 8 days after the tv was delivered . thankfully we had an option where in we could book an mi technician for the mi app . well i know even teenager can easily setup the tv but if you do it yourself it will void warranty and that is why you have to wait for there technician to arrive who by the way was very quick . alright let 's move to pros and cons . . . \ n \ npros . . . \ n1 . value for money . \ n2 . looks great and is light weight . \ n3 . it 's got both android as well as patchwall . and with a strong wifi connection you wo n't need cable or dish antenna connection any more . \ n4 . for an average room the built in speakers are enough . \ n5 . patch wall has a lot of free content to offer and when connected to your android phone there is whole lot of possible things that you can do , being able to play pub g on medium settings is my favourite . \ n6 . you can connect your pendrive to side load apps as well . \ n7 . trick : side load thopp tv app to watch paid content for free . \ n8 . voice command on mi remote works as good as in any android phone . \ n \ ncons . . \ n1 . while the speakers are loud and clear with android tv apps and patchwall it somehow seems muffled up with cable connection . \ n2 . same applies with display . normal sd connection cable picture quality is disappointing one needs an hd connection for better experience . \ n3 . wifi range isnt very powerful had to shift my mi wifi router from bedroom to hall for a steady connection . \ n",2644.jpg

Also, most laptop/desktop motherboards easily support varying lengths of m.2 SSDs like 2242 2260 and the longest 2280 (22 is the width in mm where as the last 2 numbers i.e. 42, 60 and 80 are the lengths in mm).\n\nAlso, a 2.5 inch (7 mm or 9 mm) HDD/SSD enclosure can also be bought so that you can keep your old HDD/SSD as a portable HDD/SSD within the enclosure. I bought the transparent ORICO 2.5 mm model 2193U3 HDD/SSD enclosure (have reviewed that as well) and i keep my 7200 rpm 1TB HDD inside this enclosure after having it replaced with the 2TB Samsung 870 EVO.\n\nLikewise, there is also an enclosure for the m.2 NVME PCIE SSD available from the same brand, ORICO. Check it out at amazon.in as well.\n\nSo, I made a BOOTABLE win10 usb (using the Windows Medial tool online) so that I can install the OS on the newly installed m.2 2280 ssd and the entire process took less than 30 mins from hardware installation to OS inatallation from USB to the new m.2 ssd.\n\nThere is Less to No Comparison of Quality and Price of Samsung SSDs with other brands like Sabrent, Crucial, WD etc.\n\nKindly like the review if it helped to make your buying decision that much easier.\n\nCheers and e-peace...\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A18LEeAZrFL._SY88.jpg,3,best bang for you buck .,"\ n hello amazonians , \ n \ nmy existing setup is as follows :\ nlaptop : legion y740 15inch with rtx 2070 maxq \ nhdd : 1tb 2 . 5 inch ( 7mm ) 7200rpm ( stock ) \ nssd : 128gb m . 2 nvme pcie 2242 m + b key ( stock ) with win 10home \ n \ nwanted to upgrade both the :\ na . ) existing 1tb 7200 rpm hdd as well as the \ nb . ) 128gb m . 2 nvme pcie ssd \ n \ nwith :\ n \ na . ) 2tb samsung 870 evo 2 . 5 inch sata ssd \ nb . ) 1tb samsung 980 m . 2 ( 2280 ) nvme pcie ssd m key ( for win 10 os ) . \ n \ nas i only use the lenovo legion y740 15 "" for gaming purpose so with games having humongous download sizes , 1tb hdd was filling up faster ( was left with only 250gb of 1tb space ) and also the 7200rpm drive was real slow for game load times ( waiting of 3-5 mins ) for a game load . \ n \ nas of the current gen , a nvme pcie based m . 2 ssd is the fastest drive in the market and samsung 980 is the latest iteration from its new lineup of m . 2 . \ n \ nofcourse there are the pro version m . 2 ' s as well but those are just out of budget and out of scope from a gaming / home use kind of scenarios unless one is into heavy video editing , designing and vfx purposes . \ n \ ninstalling both the ssds is fairly simple as just the screws are to be removed ( follow your laptop manual for the same ) and pop in these in their respective slots and secure them with screws . \ n \ na word of caution though : m . 2 slot on the laptop / desktop motherboard are mostly "" m key "" based ( female notch placed at the right side of a m . 2 ssd that goes into the male notch on the motherboard ) . also , most laptop / desktop motherboards easily support varying lengths of m . 2 ssds like 2242 2260 and the longest 2280 ( 22 is the width in mm where as the last 2 numbers i . e . 42 , 60 and 80 are the lengths in mm ) . \ n \ nalso , a 2 . 5 inch ( 7 mm or 9 mm ) hdd / ssd enclosure can also be bought so that you can keep your old hdd / ssd as a portable hdd / ssd within the enclosure . i bought the transparent orico 2 . 5 mm model 2193u3 hdd / ssd enclosure ( have reviewed that as well ) and i keep my 7200 rpm 1tb hdd inside this enclosure after having it replaced with the 2tb samsung 870 evo . \ n \ nlikewise , there is also an enclosure for the m . 2 nvme pcie ssd available from the same brand , orico . check it out at amazon . in as well . \ n \ nso , i made a bootable win 10 usb ( using the windows medial tool online ) so that i can install the os on the newly installed m . 2 2280 ssd and the entire process took less than 30 mins from hardware installation to os inatallation from usb to the new m . 2 ssd . \ n \ nthere is less to no comparison of quality and price of samsung ssds with other brands like sabrent , crucial , wd etc . \ n \ nkindly like the review if it helped to make your buying decision that much easier . \ n \ ncheers and e-peace . . . \ n",3896.jpg

May Disappoint - Dependent on Reader's Expectation.,"\n The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.\n\nThe book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.\n\nThe chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.\n\nI was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.\n\nThe hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture.

Wide angle is usable but not the best. I never used macro and depth.\nSecondary camera is also good at this price. Note : I disable beauty modes etc, those just make your face look weird.\nAttached a same photo in regular mode, not 64 ( blacked out serial number intentionally 😃 ). I'm sure that image will compress when uploading but believe me it's good.\n\nAudio call and network quality is good. No Bluetooth or wifi issues. Dolby Atmos is good to change the equalizer to your taste.\n\nDisplay has awesome contrast and colors and you can change settings for it.\nPlease do buy a case, the back plastic is a fingerprint magnet. Also you don't want to drop test the beautiful screen. Build quality good, but it is not that great when compared to Nokia or Samsung S or A series.\n\nComing from stock android the OneUI is good, it takes some time getting used to it. Miss the haptic feedback on keyboard. Do opt out of the marketing stuff in the initial setup to get the best experience. Some oneUI features are really awesome.\n\nOn software I would caution users to read online reviews before updating the Samsung updates.

The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12µm.

Realme is 1inch longer than JBL c100si. But Realme gives 6 months warranty and JBL gives 1 year warranty. Both has mic. But JBL has one control button and Realme has three buttons, one control button and other two to increase or decrease volume. JBL hasn't any rubber band/strap to organise it's cable. Realme cable are braided nylon cord whereas JBL use normal rubber material cable. Though both are tangle free, but Realme is better in terms of cable quality and to manage it's cable than JBL.\n\nNow comparing sound quality, I found JBL far better than Realme. Many YouTube blogger said that Realme sound is best in ₹600 -700 price range earphone segment because of it's 11mm driver. They gave better position to Realme than JBL. Though Realme has 11mm driver, but it's sound is noisy. JBL sound quality is smoother than Realme. Bass and treble everything is clear and the sound doesn't disturb your ear. I can say it sounds like Sony music system. You will surely love to listen music with JBL c100si earphone.\n\nIn terms of fitting, both are good.

The seller has placed multiple routers in a single ad. The Star ratings that you see is an aggregate of all the routers. Therefore, let me first clarify that this review is about the TP-WR902AC Travel Router. Seller has put so many routers on the same page either inadvertently - or deliberately. Either way, it misleads customers.\n\nWhen you start to set up the router, it asks whether you want to configure this as a ""3G/4G Router"" or as a ""Wireless Router"". One of my uploaded images clearly shows ""3G/4G USB"" written beside the USB port. If you are seeing Q&amp;A to understand this router, you will have seen some answers saying that there is no USB port. If you have been to the Q&amp;A section, I am sure you are as confused as I was.\n\nNot only does this router have a USB port - the port serves a dual purpose.\n* In 3G/4G mode, this is where you connect the dongle\n* In Wireless Router mode, this accepts an external USB which can be accessed by your devices with proper configuration. I have added a screenshot for this too - showing my external USB disk partitions as sda1 and sda2\n\nConfiguration is easy - my son (12th std) got to work on a router for the first time and he did it in minutes. Both 5 GHz and 2.4GHz WiFi working excellently (Yes - you will have two WiFi signals from this one, as the AC suffix suggests)\n\nIf you configure this as a repeater, you will experience loss of speed (as with ALL repeaters - something which I explained in my review of the Netgear EX3110 extender ... search for ASIN: ""B07B1B2CZT""). However, in my case I pulled a LAN cable from my main router to this one. This makes it simple to connect - just select ""dynamic IP"" and your router is connected. I get ISP speed and hence happy about it.\n\nJust beside the ethernet connector, there is a switch to select whether you want to share ethernet, share a hotspot or create an Access Point.\n\nSignals are very strong (as expected, the 2.4GHz gives higher range while 5GHz gives better Signal-Noise ratio). The 2.4 GHz is reaching a third room about 20 feet away - penetrating two walls. So yes - the signal is good.\n\nThree dampeners why I gave one star less:\n1. Cable is just about 1 foot long (see image). Now *that* is cost cutting. I had to use an extension board to be able to place it on the table. Plug point is just about a metre higher. Wonder how much profit TP Link is making by saving the cable length !!\n2. The MiniUSB charging port is a bit inside - therefore every miniUSB charging cable may not be suitable (it will keep falling off). To get a proper one, you need to see and compare the sizes to buy the longest (This one needs an additional 1mm to fit properly). This is not the only device with this issue - and there are many cables easily available - only you need to physically search for it. Online purchases may not work.\n3. This does *NOT* accept third party software. dd-wrt definitely is incompatilbe. OpenWRT includes this under their compatible routers list, but their forum says they lose the 5GHz band. Also - no clarity whether OpenWRT will support the 3G/4G mode. However, the OEM firmware is great in itself offer many options to use. So I suggest you stick to it.\n\nThe hardware version I got was TL-WR902AC v3 00000001 which probably uses a Mediatek card. The preloaded firmware was 0.9.1 0.2 v008a.0 Build 191209 Rel.57116n(5553). When I tried to upgrade from the India site, it said incompatible firmware and when I googled more to realize that this is probably a US firmware. I tried to upgrade to the US firmware and was told that the router already already the latest, so no changes made here.\n\nSUMMARY\nPros: Ethernet input, Dual-purpose USB, 3G/4G support and rock solid dual-band signals in a pocket-sized package costing less than ₹ 2000 ... I guess that speaks volumes to help you decide.\nCons: Short power cable (1 foot) and no compatibility with dd-wrt or OpenWRT made me reduce one star.\n\nI felt that this is truly what it claims to be - a powerful travel router with 3G/4G mode available.\n",1,sadness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nIVk4NOoL._SY88.jpg,4,this review is about the tp-wr 902ac travel router ( do not confuse with other routers here ),"\ n first of all - please get this fact right . the seller has placed multiple routers in a single ad . the star ratings that you see is an aggregate of all the routers . therefore , let me first clarify that this review is about the tp-wr 902ac travel router . seller has put so many routers on the same page either inadvertently - or deliberately . either way , it misleads customers . \ n \ nwhen you start to set up the router , it asks whether you want to configure this as a "" 3g / 4g router "" or as a "" wireless router "" . one of my uploaded images clearly shows "" 3g / 4g usb "" written beside the usb port . if you are seeing q & a to understand this router , you will have seen some answers saying that there is no usb port . if you have been to the q & a section , i am sure you are as confused as i was . \ n \ nnot only does this router have a usb port - the port serves a dual purpose . \ n * in 3g / 4g mode , this is where you connect the dongle \ n * in wireless router mode , this accepts an external usb which can be accessed by your devices with proper configuration . i have added a screenshot for this too - showing my external usb disk partitions as sda 1 and sda 2 \ n \ nconfiguration is easy - my son ( 12th std ) got to work on a router for the first time and he did it in minutes . both 5 ghz and 2 . 4 ghz wifi working excellently ( yes - you will have two wifi signals from this one , as the ac suffix suggests ) \ n \ nif you configure this as a repeater , you will experience loss of speed ( as with all repeaters - something which i explained in my review of the netgear ex3110 extender . . . search for asin : "" b07b1b2czt "" ) . however , in my case i pulled a lan cable from my main router to this one . this makes it simple to connect - just select "" dynamic ip "" and your router is connected . i get isp speed and hence happy about it . \ n \ njust beside the ethernet connector , there is a switch to select whether you want to share ethernet , share a hotspot or create an access point . \ n \ nsignals are very strong ( as expected , the 2 . 4 ghz gives higher range while 5ghz gives better signal-noise ratio ) . the 2 . 4 ghz is reaching a third room about 20 feet away - penetrating two walls . so yes - the signal is good . \ n \ nthree dampeners why i gave one star less :\ n1 . cable is just about 1 foot long ( see image ) . now * that * is cost cutting . i had to use an extension board to be able to place it on the table . plug point is just about a metre higher . wonder how much profit tp link is making by saving the cable length ! ! \ n2 . the miniusb charging port is a bit inside - therefore every miniusb charging cable may not be suitable ( it will keep falling off ) . to get a proper one , you need to see and compare the sizes to buy the longest ( this one needs an additional 1mm to fit properly ) . this is not the only device with this issue - and there are many cables easily available - only you need to physically search for it . online purchases may not work . \ n3 . this does * not * accept third party software . dd-wrt definitely is incompatilbe . openwrt includes this under their compatible routers list , but their forum says they lose the 5ghz band . also - no clarity whether openwrt will support the 3g / 4g mode . however , the oem firmware is great in itself offer many options to use . so i suggest you stick to it . \ n \ nthe hardware version i got was tl-wr 902ac v3 00000001 which probably uses a mediatek card . the preloaded firmware was 0 . 9 . 1 0 . 2 v008a . 0 build 191209 rel . 57116n ( 5553 ) . when i tried to upgrade from the india site , it said incompatible firmware and when i googled more to realize that this is probably a us firmware . i tried to upgrade to the us firmware and was told that the router already already the latest , so no changes made here . \ n \ nsummary \ npros : ethernet input , dual-purpose usb , 3g / 4g support and rock solid dual-band signals in a pocket-sized package costing less than ₹ 2000 . . . i guess that speaks volumes to help you decide . \ ncons : short power cable ( 1 foot ) and no compatibility with dd-wrt or openwrt made me reduce one star . \ n \ ni felt that this is truly what it claims to be - a powerful travel router with 3g / 4g mode available . \ n",3414.jpg

Make sure that whatever you plug this into has a GE port. GE stands for Gigabit Ethernet. Without GE on your modem, this will be a waste of money for you.\n\nLast point, make sure that you're using at least a Cat5E cable for the connection.

Is it compatible with old system like decade old or having SATA 2.0 or SATA 1.0 ?\nAns. Yes it's compatible but speed will be reduced to SATA 2.0 or SATA 1.0.\n\nSome old system requires BIOS update to fully recognised the SSD , so keep your BIOS up to date(If BIOS update is available).\n\n2. Which attributes in SMART(Self monitoring , analysis reporting technology ) to be checked for SSD health?\nAns. Download Crystal disk info to check smart attributes.\nIn smart attribute, check for wear leveling count it is directly related to the health of the SSD, as you write on SSD ,wear leveling count decreases.\nSome may notice that just after some 200 GB write wear leveling decreases to 99 from 100 but in reality it only decrease by 0.1 ,that is from 100 to 99.9.\n\n3. Impact on SSD on sudden shut down i.e., power cutoff ?\nAns. Now a days SSD can resist power cutoff but its highly recommended to not do sudden shut down as repeatedly doing may cause SSD to fail.\nIn SMART attribute check for POR(Power On Recovery) count ,it will tell how many times SSD goes shutdown unexpectedly. For every one sudden power off POR count increases by 1.\n\n4. What to check just after upgrading to SSD ?\nAns. Check Power on count , power on hours, both must be at zero initially.\nAll the attributes should be at 100 in crystal disk info. If not then it is used one and should be replaced.\n\n5. Warranty issue on Samsung ?\nAns. Upon registration on Samsung website it is showing out of warranty , don't worry it will honor the warranty according to the invoice provided.\n\n6. Warning : Never defrag the SSD as it will rewrite the same data on the same section of the SSD which can cause poor wear leveling and repeatedly defragmentation may cause SSD to fail.\nOS like Windows 7 or XP do defrag the SSD so keep them disabled permanently.\n\n7. For Mac users whose SSD becomes very slow or gets failed after 1 or 1.5 years it is because in mac the trim function is disabled by default for non OEM SSD (SSD not pre-installed by Apple) so just after installing the OS in mac do enable the trim function.\n\n8. It is recommended to fresh install the OS in SSD instead of migrating OS from HDD to SSD as some settings is optimised for HDD which may cause trouble from SSD or SSD may not work to its maximum potential.\n\n9. Before installing the OS in SSD do change the SATA protocol from ATA or IDE to AHCI in BIOS as AHCI is optimised for SSD.\n\n10. Do know about DRAM and DRAMLESS SSD and choose the SSD wisely , DRAM SSD is costly but having much faster RANDOM read and write than Dramless SSD.\n\n11. Don't tweak the OS default settings just for sake of SSD health like virtual memory or fast startup as it may cause your system unstable, don't worry about TBW value as it requires many years even to reach 50 percent of total TBW.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617a-YT72kL._SY88.jpg,3,ssd is 4g of computer technology .,"\ n i am writing this review after using this ssd for about 2 months . \ nso far it is working really good without any bsod ( blue screen of death ) or any other issues . \ ni am mentioning some points which will remove your doubt regarding the upgrade to ssd . \ n \ n1 . is it compatible with old system like decade old or having sata 2 . 0 or sata 1 . 0 ? \ nans . yes it 's compatible but speed will be reduced to sata 2 . 0 or sata 1 . 0 . \ n \ nsome old system requires bios update to fully recognised the ssd , so keep your bios up to date ( if bios update is available ) . \ n \ n2 . which attributes in smart ( self monitoring , analysis reporting technology ) to be checked for ssd health ? \ nans . download crystal disk info to check smart attributes . \ nin smart attribute , check for wear leveling count it is directly related to the health of the ssd , as you write on ssd , wear leveling count decreases . \ nsome may notice that just after some 200 gb write wear leveling decreases to 99 from 100 but in reality it only decrease by 0 . 1 , that is from 100 to 99 . 9 . \ n \ n3 . impact on ssd on sudden shut down i . e . , power cutoff ? \ nans . now a days ssd can resist power cutoff but its highly recommended to not do sudden shut down as repeatedly doing may cause ssd to fail . \ nin smart attribute check for por ( power on recovery ) count , it will tell how many times ssd goes shutdown unexpectedly . for every one sudden power off por count increases by 1 . \ n \ n4 . what to check just after upgrading to ssd ? \ nans . check power on count , power on hours , both must be at zero initially . \ nall the attributes should be at 100 in crystal disk info . if not then it is used one and should be replaced . \ n \ n5 . warranty issue on samsung ? \ nans . upon registration on samsung website it is showing out of warranty , do n't worry it will honor the warranty according to the invoice provided . \ n \ n6 . warning : never defrag the ssd as it will rewrite the same data on the same section of the ssd which can cause poor wear leveling and repeatedly defragmentation may cause ssd to fail . \ nos like windows 7 or xp do defrag the ssd so keep them disabled permanently . \ n \ n7 . for mac users whose ssd becomes very slow or gets failed after 1 or 1 . 5 years it is because in mac the trim function is disabled by default for non oem ssd ( ssd not pre-installed by apple ) so just after installing the os in mac do enable the trim function . \ n \ n8 . it is recommended to fresh install the os in ssd instead of migrating os from hdd to ssd as some settings is optimised for hdd which may cause trouble from ssd or ssd may not work to its maximum potential . \ n \ n9 . before installing the os in ssd do change the sata protocol from ata or ide to ahci in bios as ahci is optimised for ssd . \ n \ n10 . do know about dram and dramless ssd and choose the ssd wisely , dram ssd is costly but having much faster random read and write than dramless ssd . \ n \ n11 . do n't tweak the os default settings just for sake of ssd health like virtual memory or fast startup as it may cause your system unstable , do n't worry about tbw value as it requires many years even to reach 50 percent of total tbw . \ n",3874.jpg

Display is bright and Sunlight visibility also fine. Ambient light sensor works as expected.\nAlways on display and double tap to wake up are handy features.\n\nBattery: it works as it should be! Typically lasts for 2 days with moderate usage.\nFew hours of youtube, long calls and even video calls(no gameplays)\nI am using it for a week now with 2 simcards.\nCharging is fast but due to huge battery takes long time if battery goes below 20%\n(Generally avoid draining phone to lower levels to maintain battery health and also to shorten charging time.)\n\nPerformance: Everything works fine. animations are buttery smooth. RAM managements looks good. It's been only one week so i will update later if anything changes.\n\nCamera: Lovely! The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.\nAttached some sample shots.\n\nMacro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.\n\nWide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.\n\nSelfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.\n\nVideo recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!\n\nSummary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!\n\n(Interestingly device came with Helo app preinstalled which is banned by govt.

Some of those were gifted by well-meaning friends. Some of them were books I bought on an impulse. Then there were books that I had waited years to read only to find them unworthy of all those years of patience. But this book by Yuval Noah Harari tops the list. Just imagine reading a book that all your friends were going gaga about, only to find that there is nothing worthwhile in it and wondering whether you are really a good reader at all, now that you don’t even like a book that the whole world around you seems to love!\n\nLet’s clear a few things first, before you think of bashing me up. This is a commendable effort by Mr. Harari to summarize the whole history of mankind and its evolutionary tale. During the initial pages, I too thought that this will be one of the best reads on anthropology. But this book promises a lot only to deceive. We statisticians use the term confirmation bias, which means the tendency to favor and present only those information that are supportive to one’s beliefs. This book is full of them. Harari had decided to present all that is wicked and weak about Homo Sapiens and he has succeeded to a large extent.\n\nNot that I am complaining. I for one have never held the notion that we humans are special beings sitting atop the food chain, placed there by a favorable god who created us all in his (or, is it a ‘her’?) own image. I think of us as a different species of apes that managed to evolve a little quicker than our cousins. Despite our use of advanced languages, costly clothes and snazzy gadgets, internally we remain the beasts that roamed the vast forests once. I see nothing special about being human. This book helped cement that belief in my mind by discussing the idiocies and idiosyncrasies of our species as a whole.\n\nBut that’s just about it. This book isn’t ‘a brief history of humankind’, but the opinions of Mr. Harari about the various aspects of human evolution. This isn’t a chronological history in the lines of ‘What on Earth Happened?’ by Christopher Lloyd or ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’ by Bill Bryson, both of which I found to be far more informative and interesting than this one. This is both a philosophical take and passing of judgments by Mr. Harari on what he considers to be the vital cogs of human evolution, namely Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution &amp; Scientific Revolution. There is nothing that you end up learning that you already didn’t learn, especially in case you had read those two aforementioned books.\n\nSorry, dear friends.

I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.\nAfter this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.\nI like the look &amp; feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.\nOverall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front &amp; rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.\nFor me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).\nIn short, I would say, it is a value for money device.\nI purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.\nI have used the camera in the last 5 months.

I got this after trying DairyMilk &amp; Hersheys spread &amp; it blew up the competition. Whether it be taste or consistency, it faired well and will be given preference on my shelves for long.\n\n•••••••••••••••••••\nGENERAL INFO\n•••••••••••••••••••\n\nPrice MRP: Rs 320\nQty: 290g\nCalories: 533Kcal/100g of spread\nSugar Content: 56.3g/100g of spread\n\n•••••••\nPROS\n•••••••\n1. Balanced sweetness &amp; chocolate flavor.\n2. Rich cocoa flavor to suit any of the tastebuds.\n3. Spreads easily without any trouble.\n4. The hint of Hazelnut is a nice addon.\n5. Wide-open jar for easy access &amp; airtight for longevity. If kept open it dries up soon.\n\n•••••••\nCONS\n•••••••\n1. Only one con is the cost, but again you get what you pay for. Lower the cost and accept the tradeoffs, like thin consistency, sugary taste, odd flavor, etc.\n\nCons is not at all a product issue. This spread is greatest of all. In fact, i will give it 6 stars, as i already gave 5 to Dairymilk spread.\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nDairy Milk Spread Vs Hersheys Vs Nutella\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nPersonally, I found Dairy Milk spread to be slightly better than Hershey’s owing to the reasons below. But again it’s slightly costly compared to Hershey’s.\n\n1. Thicker consistency spread\n2. More chocolaty taste (more like a simple version of dairy milk chocolate)\n\nFurther, i found Nutella better than Dairymilk, owing to reasons below. Again here, it's further costly.\n\n1. Rich cocoa or chocolate flavor. Not just Dairymilk taste.\n2. Uniform &amp; balanced consistency. Dairymilk spreads consistency was non-uniform and at times way too thick to spread.\n\n▶ Arranging them from BEST → WORST in different domains:\n\nCost Front (Price per g): Hersheys (0.74) - DairyMilk (1.00) - Nutella (1.10)\nTaste Front: Nutella - DairyMilk - Hersheys\nBalanced consistency: Nutella - DairyMilk - Hersheys\n\n••••••••••••••••••\nFinal VERDICT\n••••••••••••••••••\n\nNutella is any time recommended over other spreads if you could go with the cost. Its balanced spread with rich taste which won't ever disappoint any of cocoa flavor lover.\n\n▶ Many people comment on the sugar content of spreads, but these are meant to be that way else you would end up applying more of it to have the taste. Also reducing it will have a significant impact on cost.\n\n▶ You may try all of Hershey’s, Nutella and Dairy milk and then finalize your taste.

Therefore, if you see that it's too liquidy, it's GOOD. It signifies that no emulsifiers had been used, which other companies such as Sundrop and Disano use. However, to get the solid texture back, mix the peanut butter for a while (it was quite a job to do in the 2.5 KG box), and put it in the fridge. It'll have a solid texture by the next morning.

It was cold during that time so these provided a good snugly warm feel but soon i noticed that as time passed temp started to rise resulting in sweat during summertime. I have to take them off after 1 hr of usage and wipe sweat which is pretty inconvenient. I would also like to add the fact that my ears are big and due to that i can't wear them for long without having pain. If you have big ears just get extra pair of pads. Also i would like to add that you can not listen comfortablely if you are outside.\n\n2}SOUND QUALITY\nThe most important part!! If you are upgrading from 4-5 k(INR) range then you will feel considerable upgrade. Sound stange is not big everything feels like its ""in your head"" . Note that sound separation is good not sound stage. Now lets come to detail retrieval, highs are boosted which make them strike a bit hard in some tracks like edm which is boosted already for ""majority"" but if you listen to guitar acoustic tracks you are gonna love it. Mids are recessed and not warm in short mids lack energy. While sub bass is adequately ""boomy"". Bass near low mid region is tight and edm tracks sound great in that region. Using eq is highly recommended if you listen to variety of genres.\n\n3} PRICING\nI got mine for 8 k (INR) which was a steal if you are getting around that price go for them. They provide a good value for that price.\n\n4} EASE OF TRAVEL\nThis is the part where M-50x's shine real well. There foldable design provide great use during traveling. Moreover they are just 38 ohm so they can be powered using smartphone or laptop whithout need of buying portable amp. Also there are 3 cables provided which come hande time to time.\nIf you've made this far,\nThank You for reading\n(•‿•)\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B+7Y5ECRL._SY88.jpg,3,pretty decent cans for a right price !,"\ n well i am going to breakdown my review into few parts :-\ n \ n1 } comfort \ ni bought these in month of jan ( 2020 ) . it was cold during that time so these provided a good snugly warm feel but soon i noticed that as time passed temp started to rise resulting in sweat during summertime . i have to take them off after 1 hr of usage and wipe sweat which is pretty inconvenient . i would also like to add the fact that my ears are big and due to that i can't wear them for long without having pain . if you have big ears just get extra pair of pads . also i would like to add that you can not listen comfortablely if you are outside . \ n \ n2 } sound quality \ nthe most important part ! ! if you are upgrading from 4-5 k ( inr ) range then you will feel considerable upgrade . sound stange is not big everything feels like its "" in your head "" . note that sound separation is good not sound stage . now lets come to detail retrieval , highs are boosted which make them strike a bit hard in some tracks like edm which is boosted already for "" majority "" but if you listen to guitar acoustic tracks you are gonna love it . mids are recessed and not warm in short mids lack energy . while sub bass is adequately "" boomy "" . bass near low mid region is tight and edm tracks sound great in that region . using eq is highly recommended if you listen to variety of genres . \ n \ n3 } pricing \ ni got mine for 8 k ( inr ) which was a steal if you are getting around that price go for them . they provide a good value for that price . \ n \ n4 } ease of travel \ nthis is the part where m - 50x ' s shine real well . there foldable design provide great use during traveling . moreover they are just 38 ohm so they can be powered using smartphone or laptop whithout need of buying portable amp . also there are 3 cables provided which come hande time to time . \ nif you 've made this far , \ nthank you for reading \ n ( • ‿ • ) \ n",2742.jpg

So far so good !! Heavy Duty Battery. Top specs at a reasonable price.,"\n I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.\nThis phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.\n\nNow coming to the phone :\n\nPros :-\n1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.\n2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.\n3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.\n4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.\n5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.\n6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.\nOther conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nNow coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :\n1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.\n2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.\n3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.\n\nOverall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718ik5N9YzL._SY88.jpg,3,awesome buy ! ! so far so good ! ! heavy duty battery . top specs at a reasonable price .,"\ n i used to be a samsung customer long back but had switched to chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now . it is very refreshing to see samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20 k segment . \ nthis phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of samsung in this price bracket . \ n \ nnow coming to the phone :\ n \ npros :-\ n1 . battery : this has to be the single largest plus point of this phone . at 6000mah , its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge . on the other hand , this battery easily lasts 1 . 5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage . \ n2 . dedicated memory slot ( 2 + 1 ) : this is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card . \ n3 . screen quality - it is fhd + screen with nice and smooth colors . there is no lag and it feels fluidic . where it scores over other brands is that samsung offers super amoled screen whereas other brands have lcd capacitive touch screen . though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one . \ n4 . camera - again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm . also , there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution . front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp . no lag in clicking front photos as well . \ n5 . size : it is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand . \ n6 . memory : 6gb ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient . plus , the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on . \ nother conviniences include - type c charging port and fast charging support and 3 . 5 mm audio jack . \ n \ nnow coming to the cons . not many but a couple i definitely noticed :\ n1 . fingerprint sensor : it is not just bad but very bad ( and i mean it ) . very unresponsive and erratic . i mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger . and it may sometimes glitch as well . so , you need to retry . \ n2 . charging cable : extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless . length is very insufficient . \ n3 . charger : it is a standard 5v - 2a charger . they could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging . \ n \ noverall if you take a look at the price ( 15k ) , it is an awesome buy . apart from the fingerprint sensor , i found everything in the phone to be top-notch . the specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer . would definitely recommend this anytime :) \ n",2420.jpg

One fine day she acquires a beautiful bright blue umbrella from some picnickers who came at the hills of Garhwal in exchange of her lucky leopard’s claw necklace.

I have been using TP Link's Wifi adapter for years so it was a natural choice. Eventually I settled for the C6 as the A6 offered no additional features and C80 and higher had a significantly higher price.\n\nAnyhow this is my initial review, which I will update if anything changes -\n\nBuild - Decent Quality. It's entirely plastic but looks durable. The shiny top surface is a finger magnet but then you won't be handling your router everyday. It is very light and can be balanced on narrow surfaces. Antennas are sturdy and maintain position if the router is moved or shaken quickly.\n\nRating - 5/5\n\nSetup - A bit tricky, this one. I'm on a Static IP FTTH connection so I assumed juet inputing values (IP, Gateway, Subnet, etc) will do the trick. However, it did not. Had to call up customer care and they asked me to change the Primary DNS. From experience I believe there was a MAC lock involved which they unlocked during the call but I can't be sure. Anyway it took about an hour and half to set every thing up. This isn't TP-LINK's fault.\n\nWhat is their fault is that MAC spoofing doesn't seem to work. So if your ISP isn't responding you may be stuck.\n\nRating - 4/5\n\nRange and Signal Strength - Both are miles ahead of my 3C. I have a three storied house with thick 45-year old brick walls. Even on the third storey (with router on the ground floor) I could get a signal. Not possible with my 3c. Of course it's the 2.4GHz one and not 5Ghz but it's there.\n\nSpeed wise 5GHz is the king snd everyone knows that. Within the room and in the next room it works pretty good. Beyond that 2.4GHz seems to work well.\n\nOne grouse I have is that ""Smart"" Connection isn't good. Smart allows your device to connect based on the connection that gets the highest speed in that range. But with Smart on my adapter (from the same brand) gave miserable 560Kbps speeds on a 130Mbps connection. This with the adapter stuck to the computer on which the router was placed.\n\nSeparating the two bands by turning off Smart resulted in a huge improvement. 2.4GHz gives up to 80 Mbps in the same room while 5Ghz gives the full 130Mbps. One floor above I get 30-40Mbps. On the second floor it falls to 10-12Mbps.\n\nSo the antenna and radio are great, but the software needs to be improved.\n\nRating - 4/5\n\nBells and Whistles - The router boasts of MU-MIMO and beam forming. Turning the former on improved my connection speed and stability by around 5-10% on the ground and first floors. Beyond that no noticeable difference could be felt.\n\nHaven't tried other features like VPN etc.\n\nRating - 5/5\n\nConclusion - Compared to the 3C this router actually allows me to enjoy the FTTH speeds I pay for. The hardware is impeccable and sturdy. The software is useful but needs some back end tweaking in the ""Smart"" department. That aside it's one of the most VFM routers under 3K for anyone with a 100Mbps connection or higher.\n\nOverall Rating - 4.5/5\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kRGFiFmvL._SY88.jpg,3,good speeds and sturdy build but needs software improvements,"\ n having burnt my fingers with a single band mi router 3c , i decided to double my budget and go for a decent router from a reputed brand . i have been using tp link 's wifi adapter for years so it was a natural choice . eventually i settled for the c6 as the a6 offered no additional features and c80 and higher had a significantly higher price . \ n \ nanyhow this is my initial review , which i will update if anything changes - \ n \ nbuild - decent quality . it 's entirely plastic but looks durable . the shiny top surface is a finger magnet but then you wo n't be handling your router everyday . it is very light and can be balanced on narrow surfaces . antennas are sturdy and maintain position if the router is moved or shaken quickly . \ n \ nrating - 5/5 \ n \ nsetup - a bit tricky , this one . i 'm on a static ip ftth connection so i assumed juet inputing values ( ip , gateway , subnet , etc ) will do the trick . however , it did not . had to call up customer care and they asked me to change the primary dns . from experience i believe there was a mac lock involved which they unlocked during the call but i can't be sure . anyway it took about an hour and half to set every thing up . this is n't tp-link 's fault . \ n \ nwhat is their fault is that mac spoofing does n't seem to work . so if your isp is n't responding you may be stuck . \ n \ nrating - 4/5 \ n \ nrange and signal strength - both are miles ahead of my 3c . i have a three storied house with thick 45 - year old brick walls . even on the third storey ( with router on the ground floor ) i could get a signal . not possible with my 3c . of course it 's the 2 . 4 ghz one and not 5ghz but it 's there . \ n \ nspeed wise 5ghz is the king snd everyone knows that . within the room and in the next room it works pretty good . beyond that 2 . 4 ghz seems to work well . \ n \ none grouse i have is that "" smart "" connection is n't good . smart allows your device to connect based on the connection that gets the highest speed in that range . but with smart on my adapter ( from the same brand ) gave miserable 560kbps speeds on a 130mbps connection . this with the adapter stuck to the computer on which the router was placed . \ n \ nseparating the two bands by turning off smart resulted in a huge improvement . 2 . 4 ghz gives up to 80 mbps in the same room while 5ghz gives the full 130mbps . one floor above i get 30-40 mbps . on the second floor it falls to 10-12 mbps . \ n \ nso the antenna and radio are great , but the software needs to be improved . \ n \ nrating - 4/5 \ n \ nbells and whistles - the router boasts of mu-mimo and beam forming . turning the former on improved my connection speed and stability by around 5-10 % on the ground and first floors . beyond that no noticeable difference could be felt . \ n \ nhave n't tried other features like vpn etc . \ n \ nrating - 5/5 \ n \ nconclusion - compared to the 3c this router actually allows me to enjoy the ftth speeds i pay for . the hardware is impeccable and sturdy . the software is useful but needs some back end tweaking in the "" smart "" department . that aside it 's one of the most vfm routers under 3k for anyone with a 100mbps connection or higher . \ n \ noverall rating - 4 . 5 / 5 \ n",3408.jpg

The dual band 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz certainly makes a big difference as compared to the single band E900.\n\nFor reference, I'm currently on the 75 Mbps plan from ACT.\n\nWith the E900, my maximum download speed was topping off at 60 Mbps. However, with the upgrade in place, I'm now getting a consistent 70+ Mbps at all times (the speeds with the E900 used to fluctuate a lot).\n\nRange too, is pretty good on this router. Do bear in mind, however, that the range will take a substantial hit when connected to the 5 GHz WiFi as compared to the 2.4 GHz.\n\nFor those of you who're new to dual band WiFi routers like me, note that this will broadcast two separate SSIDs, one for each band, depending on which your speed and range will vary.\n\nThe setup process was an absolute breeze.

But since I updated my phone to latest firmware it seems to work fine.\n• The rare of this phone is made out of plastic which fells cheap and it scratches easily I recommend getting a Good case.\n•The font camera takes poor pictures indoors. Trust me it's nothing like 32mp it's just number.\n• Performance is not that good if compare it with Realme or Redmi devices. But here is the thing performance seems to be improved with last update. I’m noticing less lag. Just don’t get this phone for gaming the chipset isn’t good enough.\n\nPros\n•Samsung is known for their Super Amoled\nScreen, this is one of the best display you can get under 20k. You will love watching HDR content on Netflix, YouTube etc.\n•On rear there are 4 cameras but i think you will only going to use ultra wide and wide. The depth camera is for portrait mode, And there is micro one for close up subject but quality isn’t good. The main 64mp camera is decent, quality is pretty great in day light but in low light it’s average. night mode dose it job in low light but use tripod if you can. Ultra wide sensor is great in bright day light.\n•LDAC support over Bluetooth is pretty sweet you will enjoy music on this phone if you have Hi-Res supported headphones.\n•This phone has 6000mah battery which is insane you can easily get throughout the day without charging your phone even if you’re heavy user you will be able to use this phone all day.\n\nSo overall i think this phone best for media consumption. Watching Netflix, youtube, playing basic games, using social media...\n\nIf you’re heavy gamer who plays PUBG, COD like game this device isn’t for you.

Read this full and i may help you clear your dilemma. If you need in depth review i have a review video on youtube. go to youtube . com / mobiletechpoint or search for ""mobile tech point Boya M1"" and you will find the review video. Audio for the Entire video has been recorded with Boya M1.\n\n1. I bought Boya M1 for 800 rupees. So this is a great pro mic for the price.\n2. first thing we notice is that the cable is 6 meters long which is super lengthy. So You have to be good in cable management. It is nice to see that battery unit is made of metal. If you use the mic with smartphones you don’t need a battery because the mic draws the power from the phone. But in case of dslr, you need to switch to camera mode. Good part of this mic is that it can connect with smartphones, tablets, pc, dslr’s and external audio recorders like zoom h1n. That’s pretty awesome right?\n3. For the price we pay, this mic gives you excellent quality audio. Having a 6-meter cable can be an advantage or disadvantage, it depends on how you look at it. If you are using the mic with external recorder you don’t need a 6m cable, but if you are using the mic with a dslr camera and if you want to move around, it gives you all the freedom. The other only concern that you need to be aware of is, since there is no battery indicator you might want to carry an extra battery. If you are going to record something important which you don’t want to miss at all, put in a new battery and you will be fine.\n4. If you are into audio recording, then Boya M1 lavalier mic is a must have. Even if you have an external audio recorder or a condenser mic, get this mic as well. I am sure this will come in handy at some point of time.\n\nIf you have any doubts, post a comment on my youtube video i will answer your query. Thanks.

The children however are most excited about the stories that Ajji is going to tell them during their stay with her.\n\nThe stories told by the grandmother are short &amp; sweet moral stories. These stories deal on wide variety of topics such as importance of:\n📍 hard work &amp;honesty\n📍being down to earth, being helpful &amp; humble &amp; content &amp; loyal\n📍having presence of mind\n📍loving people unconditionally\nAll the stories will fill you up with hope and that feeling of content that you used to feel if your grandparents also told you stories.\n\nThe narration is very effective as you will be able to retain the stories for a long time. The tone is full of warmth. The book is woven in a way to make you feel nostalgic.The book brought back strong memories of my childhood when my brother &amp; me used to travel to my native place with our parents to meet our grandparents during summer &amp; winter breaks. Those memories were overwhelming. The smile that used to break on my Amma's &amp; Dadaji's face are images that I would cherish for my lifetime. It's a shame that I lost them so early.\n\n This was my first Sudha Murty book &amp; I am so glad that I picked up her book. It brought me out of my reading slump of 2 long months. It's a very sweet &amp; a humble book. Do give it a read.

But the marketing and customer service after sales by MI provides assurance although this is a very affordabe low entry priced TV in Android market.\n\nThe setup of this fully featured Android TV is simple and effective and the pre installed apps works flawlessly. Although the video playback through wifi and chromecast even in high speed network had some playback issues in downloaded apps which is negligible if u dont install too many apps.\n\nThe best part of this MI TV is the remote which is simple and best for Internet TV users. Since its an Android based TV most people who buy this would essentially use more of the Internet content hence this remote which is simliar to Amazon Fire TV Stick is absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe only thing that needs some improvement is the Sound quality. No doubt that the speakers are loud but the voice clarity is not that clear having used to the other TV brands which cost thrice as much as this MI Android TV. For a start to start using Android fearures in a TV that too in this price segment its easily the best Android TV in the market current if u are willing to spend some money on a quality sound bar for better quality sound.\n\nBought it at a price of Rs. 12,499 without the instant discount on card payment. But if Rs. 1500 is reduced the price of Rs. 10,999 is an absoutele delight for every person who decides to but this TV with all those interesting features provided which works best as promised.

Hope I start implementing the main principle of the book right from here -how monk think at this moment ??(to write a review for the book now ). Myself being a doctor , leading a relatively more stressful phase at this Covid pandemic time , mainly due to fear of acquiring Covid disease to myself , my family members, friends , and others in the society , I am very glad to have read this book. Apart from the normal times, these Covid times have put more of stress , burden , agony and fear to all health care workers in various aspects of their life and draining them physically and mentally. There are also cases reported in healthy people who with the fear of getting covid positive or who are tested positive succumbed to death just due to their mental agony and fear of Covid . So apart from the treatment by medications and vaccines , it requires lot of mental Courage &amp; emotional support to fight and overcome such diseases . So this book in particular is must a read for everyone , to gain mental stability and positivity especially in these pandemic situations. Apart from the social distance precautions, mask wear, Diet , personal hygiene and immune booster supplementation , this book can work as a mental booster to everyone of us .\n\nThe author has beautifully divided the book into three parts - Let Go, Grow and Give , with each of the part having various chapters described under. Right from the first page , the author takes through to a wonderful ride to an enlightened atmosphere driven by a positive energy vehicle . There are various highlighted phrases , quotes and sayings described throughout the book and can be read many a times to develop positive Vibes.There is lot of focus on personality Development , positive emotions and habits described in the book which are motivating . There are beautiful Small Stories described in the book which are given as examples to apply to ourselves .There are real life incidents of the authors lifestyle at the ashram with the monks which makes us get connected and also adding liveliness to the book . The core of the book mainly deals with the different kinds of meditations to train our mind for peace and finding purpose everyday. There’s lot to be experienced internally rather than externally. Hence I am unable to put my book experience in the words .\nApart from name, fame , money , luxuries and etc , there’s lot to be dealt internally which gives more happiness to us such as by our kindness , gratitude and service which are beautifully explained in the book . The main thing which I learnt the most in the book is to find happiness internally and being grateful for what we have in our life .\n\nI would recommend this book to my friends , family members and also people who are mentally sick , so they would go through this wonderful journey of positive energy . Also in this pandemic situation, where home isolation is the main treatment for many of us , this book is a must read to improve our mental , physical and emotional stability .\nWords wouldn’t suffice to express my gratitude or thanks to the author Jayshetty and his team for delivering such a masterpiece book to the world and enhancing many lives . Words are actually short for me to describe the experience I had while reading the book . May you write many more books like these and transform as many as Possible to the positive energy.

Go through my review carefully before buying.\n\nI had iPhone 5s as my first phone. It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios.\n\nI grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster. Will update the review after few months.\n\nBuild quality is remarkable.\n\nIOS 14 is a magic.\n\nPhone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size.\n\nDo not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X.\n\nI was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision. Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple.\n\nFront and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples.\nIf you are a photo person, this one is for you.\n\nFinal verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship, be ready for repeated charge cycles. 😅\n\nThis is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life.\n\nDo check out the attached photos. Hope this helps.\n\nCheck the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected.\nThanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging.\n\nUpdate after approx one and half month of usage : Battery performance is exceeding the expectations. 😍😍\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pevhbPMRL._SY88.jpg,3,a premium device for a moderate user .,"\ n i am a techno person and hard core apple and android user . go through my review carefully before buying . \ n \ ni had iphone 5s as my first phone . it performed really well and ended up with dead battery . i had to switch to samsung m30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user . i used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use .

Some cannot be disabled as well. Of the 6GB, 1.5 GB is wasted on these apps. So you practically have only 3gb left after the OS and Samsung apps, which is not expected of 6gb ram device. A stock android phone will offer more RAM and processing power in reality, with the same hardware.\nExynos is worthy for normal use and I am not sure about gaming as I have not tried.\n\nExtra memory and battery are in place because of the bloatware the phone ships in. These are not annoying like the ones on Micromax or cheaper phones.

The nationalism of today is very different from that of what he talks about in this book.\nThe first 2/3rd portion of the book-Nationalism in Japan and America-were specifically said in context with the ongoing WW1 to both nations by the man and are simply utterly boring. He, and I am sorry for my rudeness here, doesn't speak practically or goes to the point in ANY way.

You dont arrive at any clear observations from this book. All I can now say is that Tagore ji was an extremely humane person, completely like a sage would be, saying no to weapons and creating borders and what not.

Plug your echo on and download alexa on your phone.\n\n2. From the alexa app, pair your phone with your echo device first to establish the first connection between your phone and your echo.\n\n3. We need to set up wifi access on echo so that alexa on echo can be alive. To do that, after you've paired your echo with your phone, proceed to where you can search for the available wifi networks. Connect to your wifi network on alexa app by entering your wifi password. Post this, your echo should be connected to wifi and alexa on your echo should be online.\n\n4. You can pair alexa with any bluetooth speakers if you have any. You may also pair your phone with your echo with bluetooth so that you may play your local AV via your echo. Yes you can play music from phone. To connect to bluetooth, enable pairing on your echo. To do that, command, 'Alexa pair' and you should hear alexa respond. When she does that, she is ready to pair; open your phone's bluetooth settings and connect to your echo. The connection should now be successful.\n\n5. Develop skills for alexa and keep interracting with her so that your relationship blooms. Any relationships are funny to understand at the beggining. Believe me, there is a deep meaning and truth in my previous sentence.\n\nAs for the performance part, there's no compromise from my point of view and your echo dot can easily compete with most advanced dedicated speakers of its size.\nThe bass is pretty decent. The treble is at a good feel as well. At full volume, there is no screeching or dampening. The sound is premium than previous echo dot.\nEcho plus will obviosuly nail it, way better than dot, so please do not compare plus with dot. Both peform exceptionally based on budget.\nYou cannot wire in audio to your echo dot (nevertheless, you can bluetooth in your audio), but you can wire out to external speakers. When wiring to your external speakers maintain 15cms for optimal performance.\n\nI hope this helps.

Having 6000mAh, it lasts for 1 complete day which is good, I liked it. But I thought it will last more longer, but since it has sampled display and 6GB Ram and super fast processor, it takes probably more power. But battery performance will not disappoint you, I used this mobile for Internet surfing, video calls, Netflix and YouTube and it was pretty good. Charging takes time because it has a huge battery in it, so it will take around 3 hours to fully charge it.\nPerformance -\nOver all, the mobile's performance is really fast with Samsung's own processor and 6gb Ram you will not feel any lag while using this phone and it has latest Android and security patch level so you will always enjoy while using so many apps in the background.\n\nOverall summary -\nIn this budget you are getting the features of a 20 to 25 k mobile and Samsung is a reliable brand you can trust on.

I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ics+vuFiL._SY88.jpg,3,the best decision of my life,"\ n from the last 3 months , i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect . i got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products . watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing , reviews . especially i was looking for cons rather than pros . i got to know that the display not being oled is not that good . then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model , except that everything is same . i came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts . from the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life . ios is buttery smooth , its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling . no lag whatsoever . ram management is superb . sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers . though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3 ( being a reviewer on youtube ) i get review units . next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone . it can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming . the display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels ( afterall its apple , you get what you pay ) . finally the camera makes you feel like so great . the photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc , you will see the clarity of the camera . video quality is superb . so overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs . hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not . \ n",2110.jpg

Features and specifications:\nToday I am looking at the new 860 EVO to see how Samsung has improved on the world's best selling SSD. Samsung's EVO series is so popular in some countries that it outsells every other SSD by a two to one margin. Samsung wants to leverage that proven formula with the new EVO series so it can cling to its dominant and profitable leadership position. Samsung changes its pricing when competitors close in, and the company always releases a faster model when others get too close to matching its performance.\nSamsung 860 EVO (250GB)\nCapacity (Raw / User)\n256GB / 250GB\nForm Factor\n2.5"" / M.2 2280 S3 / mSATA\nInterface / Protocol\nSATA / AHCI\nController\nSamsung MJX\n\n2. Features\nSamsung outfitted the 860 series with a new MJX controller that supports low-power DDR4 memory, so it likely has a new integrated memory controller. We also suspect the company built the MJX controller on a smaller lithography that enables lower power consumption, cooler operation, and reduced manufacturing costs.\nIf you have been an engineer either computer or electrical engineer or both you must see this following point.\n\n3.Software &amp; Accessories\nWe were able to test the latest version of Samsung's Magician software now that the drives are actually on the market. The new 860 series and the 850 non-Pro/EVO from China are now supported. They also work with Rapid Mode, which is Samsung's DRAM cache algorithm that increases performance and reduces wear on the flash.\n\n4.Packaging (Check pics included in the review)\nCan you guess what Samsung's tagline is for the 860 EVO? ""The SSD That Makes A Difference"" is emblazoned on both the front and back of the package. The warranty on the retail package. Samsung doesn't mention performance, endurance, or any other metric you might use in a retail store to compare this product to the one next to it.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D54s3AvaL._SY88.jpg,3,the 860 evo review : samsung back on top,"\ n i can proportionate my review on following points as everyone wishes to update his or her laptop or desktop to new generation laptop . \ n1 . features and specifications :\ ntoday i am looking at the new 860 evo to see how samsung has improved on the world 's best selling ssd . samsung 's evo series is so popular in some countries that it outsells every other ssd by a two to one margin . samsung wants to leverage that proven formula with the new evo series so it can cling to its dominant and profitable leadership position . samsung changes its pricing when competitors close in , and the company always releases a faster model when others get too close to matching its performance . \ nsamsung 860 evo ( 250gb ) \ ncapacity ( raw / user ) \ n256gb / 250gb \ nform factor \ n2 . 5 "" / m . 2 2280 s3 / msata \ ninterface / protocol \ nsata / ahci \ ncontroller \ nsamsung mjx \ n \ n2 . features \ nsamsung outfitted the 860 series with a new mjx controller that supports low-power ddr 4 memory , so it likely has a new integrated memory controller . we also suspect the company built the mjx controller on a smaller lithography that enables lower power consumption , cooler operation , and reduced manufacturing costs . \ nif you have been an engineer either computer or electrical engineer or both you must see this following point . \ n \ n3 . software & accessories \ nwe were able to test the latest version of samsung 's magician software now that the drives are actually on the market . the new 860 series and the 850 non-pro / evo from china are now supported . they also work with rapid mode , which is samsung 's dram cache algorithm that increases performance and reduces wear on the flash . \ n \ n4 . packaging ( check pics included in the review ) \ ncan you guess what samsung 's tagline is for the 860 evo ?

I'll share with you how my journey buying this SSD was and what I learnt and what you should know.\n\nMX500 is not the most budget-friendly and entry-level SSD out there (there is WD Green, Crucial BX500, Kingston A400 and some others) but I would say it's excellent for the price. Before the MX500, I had purchased its younger sibling, BX500, and I noticed+learnt a couple of things with that.\n1. Similar transfer speeds at around 390 MB/s\n2. SLC caching (16 GB for 240 GB variant, 32 GB for 480 GB variant and so on). What it means is that after writing 16 GB, 32 GB and so on, write speed would drop significantly because instead of writing to the SLC cache of the drive, data would be written directly to the TLC. SLC is way faster than TLC (around 400 MB/s write to the drive while using SLC cache and around 50-80 MB/s once SLC cache is full).\nThis SLC cache varies from SSD to SSD and can be seen even on premium SSDs that cost 20k-30k (it brings down the cost, otherwise those drives would cost over a lakh or something!)\nAlso, the BX500 had a 3-year warranty (MX500 has a 5-year warranty) and lower TBW (Terabytes Written) rating than the MX500. So I returned my BX500 because the performance was an issue and chose to go with MX500.\n\nPerformance of the MX500 is superb. I have it hooked to my MacBook Air using a Transcend StoreJet SATA to USB adaptor thingy just like I did with the BX500. I transferred around 80 GB data from my MacBook to the MX500, and it moved files and folders at about 350 MB/s to the drive throughout the transfer, with speed drop to around 150 MB/s 5-6 times for 3-4 seconds each time (that was because it was moving tiny files and folders). Crucial says that the MX500 has a Dynamic Write Acceleration on their website. Well, it clearly works!\n\nSo should you buy an MX500? It depends. If you are planning to buy an SSD that will probably last for years, if you plan to write lots of data to the drive, if you need an SSD as a scratch disk (for photo and video editing) or if you want an SSD that's good but costs less than the Samsung SSDs, then go for MX500. I'm building a PC in a couple of weeks and I'll use the MX500 as the boot device in that.\nHowever, if you have an old laptop that is extremely slow and takes forever to start, maybe you have desktop with some old, failing hard drive and you are looking for an SSD, and you are not a heavy user (that is you'll browse the web, write emails and do stuff like that), then save some money (if you wish) and go for the BX500.\n\nAbout the delivery of the product, I got an empty box when I ordered the MX500 from Amazon. Once I got it and saw that the item was missing, I brought it to Amazon's notice, and they said they would take two days to conduct an investigation. However, when I called the next day, I got to know that they concluded that I could get a replacement or a refund. The process for replacement wasn't very smooth (it took about a week to get a replacement unit), but in the end, I got the product, and the product is pretty much excellent like I had expected, hence the five stars.\n\nAnother important thing that I want to mention is that the MRP in the box of the 500 GB variant of the MX500 is Rs 8,400 (screenshot attached) and at the time of writing this review on 30 June 2020, there are a couple of sellers on Amazon named ""Cart2India Online"" and ""Cart2India SLP"" who are selling the product at twice the price (Rs 14,358). There are some other sellers also who list the MRP as Rs 9,000 or 10,000 and then say they are providing a discount of Rs 4,000 or Rs 5,000 when in fact, they are only offering a discount of Rs 2,500 or something. I especially saw this with the seller ""Gadget Buggy"". Basically, AVOID THESE SELLERS and buy from Appario Retail Private Ltd or the other Fulfilled By Amazon sellers.\n",0,happiness,2,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mS+VsIiML._SY88.jpg,3,the perfect ssd for many even in 2020 ( also check the mrp listed by seller ),"\ n so i did n't know much about ssds before i set out to buy one . i 'll share with you how my journey buying this ssd was and what i learnt and what you should know . \ n \ nmx 500 is not the most budget-friendly and entry-level ssd out there ( there is wd green , crucial bx500 , kingston a400 and some others ) but i would say it 's excellent for the price . before the mx500 , i had purchased its younger sibling , bx500 , and i noticed + learnt a couple of things with that . \ n1 . similar transfer speeds at around 390 mb / s \ n2 . slc caching ( 16 gb for 240 gb variant , 32 gb for 480 gb variant and so on ) . what it means is that after writing 16 gb , 32 gb and so on , write speed would drop significantly because instead of writing to the slc cache of the drive , data would be written directly to the tlc . slc is way faster than tlc ( around 400 mb / s write to the drive while using slc cache and around 50-80 mb / s once slc cache is full ) . \ nthis slc cache varies from ssd to ssd and can be seen even on premium ssds that cost 20k - 30k ( it brings down the cost , otherwise those drives would cost over a lakh or something ! ) \ nalso , the bx500 had a 3 - year warranty ( mx500 has a 5 - year warranty ) and lower tbw ( terabytes written ) rating than the mx500 . so i returned my bx500 because the performance was an issue and chose to go with mx500 . \ n \ nperformance of the mx500 is superb . i have it hooked to my macbook air using a transcend storejet sata to usb adaptor thingy just like i did with the bx500 . i transferred around 80 gb data from my macbook to the mx500 , and it moved files and folders at about 350 mb / s to the drive throughout the transfer , with speed drop to around 150 mb / s 5-6 times for 3-4 seconds each time ( that was because it was moving tiny files and folders ) . crucial says that the mx500 has a dynamic write acceleration on their website . well , it clearly works ! \ n \ nso should you buy an mx500 ? it depends . if you are planning to buy an ssd that will probably last for years , if you plan to write lots of data to the drive , if you need an ssd as a scratch disk ( for photo and video editing ) or if you want an ssd that 's good but costs less than the samsung ssds , then go for mx500 . i 'm building a pc in a couple of weeks and i 'll use the mx500 as the boot device in that . \ nhowever , if you have an old laptop that is extremely slow and takes forever to start , maybe you have desktop with some old , failing hard drive and you are looking for an ssd , and you are not a heavy user ( that is you 'll browse the web , write emails and do stuff like that ) , then save some money ( if you wish ) and go for the bx500 . \ n \ nabout the delivery of the product , i got an empty box when i ordered the mx500 from amazon . once i got it and saw that the item was missing , i brought it to amazon 's notice , and they said they would take two days to conduct an investigation . however , when i called the next day , i got to know that they concluded that i could get a replacement or a refund . the process for replacement was n't very smooth ( it took about a week to get a replacement unit ) , but in the end , i got the product , and the product is pretty much excellent like i had expected , hence the five stars . \ n \ nanother important thing that i want to mention is that the mrp in the box of the 500 gb variant of the mx500 is rs 8,400 ( screenshot attached ) and at the time of writing this review on 30 june 2020 , there are a couple of sellers on amazon named "" cart 2india online "" and "" cart 2india slp "" who are selling the product at twice the price ( rs 14,358 ) . there are some other sellers also who list the mrp as rs 9,000 or 10,000 and then say they are providing a discount of rs 4,000 or rs 5,000 when in fact , they are only offering a discount of rs 2,500 or something . i especially saw this with the seller "" gadget buggy "" . basically , avoid these sellers and buy from appario retail private ltd or the other fulfilled by amazon sellers . \ n",3947.jpg

After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.\n\n-----------------------************------------------------\n\nHere are the pros from the last few days of usage:\n\n1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).\n\n2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.\n\n3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.\n\n4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.\n\n5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.\n\n6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).\n\n7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.\n\n------------------------***********-----------------------\n\nCons:\n\n1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.\n\n2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.\n\n3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.\n\n4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).\n\n5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text.

perfect combination of features !,"\ n this is my first iphone . after being an android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade , poor pixel design and besting camera of iphone 11 made me switch to the walled garden . coming from samsung galaxy s7 edge i had my doubts on the lcd screen and low resolution , but believe me my doubts were unfounded . the screen on iphone 11 is crisp and clear , with good color accuracy and balanced punch . i did a lot research comparing iphone 11 , the pro and max models as well , along with note 10 and oneplus 7t pro . comparing them side by side , iphone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me ( which had made me choose s7 years ago ) . i also looked at iphone xr , but the 11 offers substantial updates over xr . \ n \ n - - - * * * - - - \ n \ nhere are the pros from the last few days of usage :\ n \ n1 ) excellent battery life - i consistently end my day at 40 + % . all while i am still exploring the phone ( and hence using it more ) . \ n \ n2 ) dual camera system - the normal iphone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - i can live without the telephoto . essentially the same quality as the pro . pictures are true to life , accurate in color and great hdr . low light performance is again top notch . \ n \ n3 ) a13 bionic and butter smooth experience . never experienced lag free ui before - even 12gb ram model note 10 stuttered when testing . \ n \ n4 ) promise of timely updates , straight from apple . no oem bs . this is an underrated and misunderstood parameter . i am paying comparable money for android phones and getting latest os after 6 + months and that too for only 2 years ( followed by 1 year of security updates ) . apple 's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical . \ n \ n5 ) build quality and design are unparalleled . love the design - grows on you . apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports , ui elements , the milled camera cutout , etc . \ n \ n6 ) gestures - android does a piss poor job of this . samsung 's dumb implementation on note 10 killed it for me . i do n't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it gestures . ios does it so much better and in an intuitive style . i wonder how i was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button ( and pixel 's implementation is pathetic and confusing ) . \ n \ n7 ) face id is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on android . i do n't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone . seems face id and gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience . i can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation . it 's these small things that makes apple what it is - a pleasurable experience . \ n \ n - - - * * * - - - \ n \ ncons :\ n \ n1 ) lcd - the phone 's biggest weakness is the screen . do n't get me wrong its an excellent lcd , only marred by lack of true blacks . even then i am using the dark mode coz i like it . \ n \ n2 ) photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on whatsapp . had to restart the phone to solve the issue . hope this was an one off error . \ n \ n3 ) 5w charger - at this price it 's fair to expect a fast charger , given the phone is capable of fast charging . \ n \ n4 ) few apps that were free on android are paid on ios . i was surprised to find this . nonetheless i bought the app as it was critical for me ( did n't want to lose years of data from android ) . \ n \ n5 ) default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text . increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp . \ n \ n6 ) 3rd party keyboard - can not be used in some apps . only the pre-installed apple keyboard shows up ( maybe some security reason ) . this leads to poor trying experience . e . g . in the outlook app swiftkey never shows up . ca n't get my head around this , as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience . \ n \ n -

Shoot an uninterrupted video of the delivery you receive from the delivery guy and unboxing\n2. Ensure you capture the entire phone and accessories and point out any damage/defect (if observed)\n3. Check for the imei number from apple site and imei24 on status of any imei\n4. Boot the phone and wait for ""Apple logo to load"" setup the face lock - This is a key feature which nobody can copy\n5. Try locking the phone and unlocking the phone 4-5times using face unlock\n6. Screen bezels should be uniform from left, Right and bottom sides\n7. No additional softwares apart from Apple defaults\n\nWhat did I like about this phone?\n1. Great body and design - Feels and fits perfect in hand (Damn balanced)\n2. Stellar Camera - Even a Novice would be able to capture great pictures and very easy yet powerful editing features\n3. Super fluid OS experience - Now I understood what ""Buttery experience meant all these years""\n4. Battery life is good, Screen-On-Time of ~7hours depending on the usage - I had my Wifi continuously switched on and Bluetoth for ~2hrs - I must say for 3100mah battery it very well optimized compared to 4000mah of other phones\n5. Wireless charging - (Which might be useful for some people but not me)\n6. A great deal from Security, Experience, Durability and Hardware Perspective\n7. Still providing Charger and Earpods(Wired) - So better go for this compared to Apple online store\n\nWhat is not present but doesn't make difference?\n1. 90Hz display could have made it amazing but can't expect that from a year-old model and doesnt make difference in india at least\n2. 5G is not present - So, good to go for 2-3years without updating any further than IOS15\n3. InBox charger could have been 12W(2hr charging time) charger instead of 5W(3.5hr charging time) - OnePlus provide 40min charging\n4. Super Amoled could have improved the viewing experience but its still fine\n\nRecommendation: If can spend up to 55k then just go for it without any hesitation. Better than any 40-50k phone out there. Colors available are also great. I was looking for Mint but didn't get it. Try your luck though.

Because my ears are the smallest ears to be found(according to my family and friends)😄😄😄 and only the smallest size of ear buds fit in my ears. And I didn't get the smallest size of earbuds with this earphone.So, had to arrange it from outside.\nThat's not a big issue as it seems. But lemme tell you, if the earbuds are not fitting perfectly inside, then, audio experience and the noise cancellation property, all goes in vain because your earphones would be falling out of your ear every now and then which is very irritating.\n2. And being from a middle class household, Honestly it was a bit costly for me🙄...but i saved money and purchased it.No regrets for that. It's awesome.But to prevent any damage to it,I covered it up with cover(spiral wires).\nOtherwise, no problem at all. It's the perfect earphone in this price range👌\nTotally happy😊\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81oBtlhJd1L._SY88.jpg,3,"costly , but worth it :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: :ok_hand:","\ n pros :-\ n1 . excellent noise cancellation for this price range . and if the music is on , you wo n't be able to listen majority of things going on outside . even in great traffic , it cuts the noise to half of the original intensity without any music . with music , it cuts off the noise upto 97 % . \ n2 . sound is perfectly balanced . it was a great experience to listen to all the genres with it . i had absolutely no problem with it . it 's been a year now since i am using them and they are still perfect man ! :ok_hand: :ok_hand: :ok_hand: \ n3 . mike is located at the perfect spot and has a good power if catching sound . the mike button also works pretty well . \ n4 . have recommended it to all my friends and they loved it too . \ ncon :-\ nthis may be only in my case . because my ears are the smallest ears to be found ( according to my family and friends ) :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: and only the smallest size of ear buds fit in my ears . and i did n't get the smallest size of earbuds with this earphone . so , had to arrange it from outside . \ nthat 's not a big issue as it seems . but lemme tell you , if the earbuds are not fitting perfectly inside , then , audio experience and the noise cancellation property , all goes in vain because your earphones would be falling out of your ear every now and then which is very irritating . \ n2 . and being from a middle class household , honestly it was a bit costly for me :face_with_rolling_eyes: . . . but i saved money and purchased it . no regrets for that . it 's awesome . but to prevent any damage to it , i covered it up with cover ( spiral wires ) . \ notherwise , no problem at all . it 's the perfect earphone in this price range :ok_hand: \ ntotally happy :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: \ n",2161.jpg

It's light weight &amp; design is almost similar to Mi LED TV 4A.\n\nPicture quality is not the very best but it's good. Resolution is 1366×768 means it is only a HD ready panel. I checked on tv upto 4k videos on YouTube &amp; full hd videos on USB drive was playing smoothly but after 720p no major difference in quality of video on higher resolution. I feel little bit better quality display in comparison of Mi LED TV 4A. One thing to notice on display that corners are little but darker when your screen is white. Overall picture quality is acceptable.\n\nSound output is almost same as Mi Led TV 4A. It comes with 10w×2 two speakers setup &amp; it is loud &amp; clear upto 70% volume. I feel little bit distortion on high volume but I say it is one the best the sound output in TVs in this price segment.\n\nNow talk software/os it runs on Android 8.1 &amp; Patchwall. Android gives you freedom to download tons of apps from play store which is already available on tv. You can set up your android smartphone with tv. Share your smartphone content to tv easily through Google cast because it comes with Chromecast built in. Youtube works flawlessly if internet speed is good. Patchwall gives lots of content from many online content partners some are free and some paid but it's good.\n\nTv comes with lots of connectivity features.

Pathetic Quality Check!!!,"\n I am from Hyderabad. Like all of you, I also read all the above reviews, watched YouTube videos, thought a lot and finally decided on this 31.5 inch Acer monitor. From years, I am stuff buying from Amazon. Trusting the brand, I paid and ordered online. As I took out of the box with lot of hope, to my bad, I saw those yellow curved at the bottom of the screen inside. Didn't expect Amazon will send such defective pieces to its loyal and prime customers. Very disappointed. Its says 2k resolution but in reality you don't actually that image quality. And, you can see in the above pictures the pathetic light bleeding from all the edges. I want to cancel this and go for a different model but Amazon for now is allowing only replacing with a fresh piece. Lets see how it will be.

No complaints for what I got for the price I paid\nSwitching from a 7 year old Sony 21"" to a Mi TV 43"", the change in both picture and audio quality is not just noticeable, it is in your face.\nI mean the audio sounds cheap and tinny. Even my JBL Bluetooth sounds better.\nThe image quality is just about suffer-able. Also if you are used to 1080p displays like on your phone, laptop, TV with much smaller screens, FHD on 43"" will give you a terrible experience especially with this TV that does ZERO anti-aliasing.I cant get past those pixel corners that are so clearly visible. If you don't understand what I am saying, look at the curve of 'M' in Mi when the TV boots up.\nBefore buying this TV i had read many review which mentioned losing WiFi connectivity or apps crashing when streaming full HD content. I myself noticed the same in one of my office TVs and attributed it to poor WiFi strength. But with this TV i can confirm that it is not the WiFi, I have a nighthawk gigabit router sitting less than 5 feet from the TV. When I connect the TV to ethernet, I dont see any more youtube crashes. So the wifi card in the TV is trashy cheap too and unable to handle heavy traffic.\nBoot-up time of the OS is not impressive either and takes ~60 seconds\n\nNow for the good parts.\nInstallation and configuration was super easy. In fact I did it myself in ~15 mins. My grandma looked like she could do it as well.\nThere is a general setting which lets you remember the last used input source. So you can use it an a dumb display with your set-top box or radio frequency TV cable. In my case I found it much more convenient to use my Jio set top box to stream online content in full HD (primevideo, youtube) than using Mi's android tv or patchwall\n\nVerdict\nThe image quality may be forgiven if you pair the TV with good home-theater audio, otherwise this TV is suitable for 1000 rs per night hotel rooms\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610K6tNNRHL._SY88.jpg,3,if you pay peanuts you will get monkey,"\ n you buy cheap and cheap is what you get . no complaints for what i got for the price i paid \ nswitching from a 7 year old sony 21 "" to a mi tv 43 "" , the change in both picture and audio quality is not just noticeable , it is in your face . \ ni mean the audio sounds cheap and tinny . even my jbl bluetooth sounds better . \ nthe image quality is just about suffer-able . also if you are used to 1080p displays like on your phone , laptop , tv with much smaller screens , fhd on 43 "" will give you a terrible experience especially with this tv that does zero anti-aliasing . i cant get past those pixel corners that are so clearly visible . if you do n't understand what i am saying , look at the curve of ' m ' in mi when the tv boots up . \ nbefore buying this tv i had read many review which mentioned losing wifi connectivity or apps crashing when streaming full hd content . i myself noticed the same in one of my office tvs and attributed it to poor wifi strength . but with this tv i can confirm that it is not the wifi , i have a nighthawk gigabit router sitting less than 5 feet from the tv . when i connect the tv to ethernet , i dont see any more youtube crashes . so the wifi card in the tv is trashy cheap too and unable to handle heavy traffic . \ nboot-up time of the os is not impressive either and takes ~ 60 seconds \ n \ nnow for the good parts . \ ninstallation and configuration was super easy . in fact i did it myself in ~ 15 mins . my grandma looked like she could do it as well . \ nthere is a general setting which lets you remember the last used input source . so you can use it an a dumb display with your set-top box or radio frequency tv cable . in my case i found it much more convenient to use my jio set top box to stream online content in full hd ( primevideo , youtube ) than using mi 's android tv or patchwall \ n \ nverdict \ nthe image quality may be forgiven if you pair the tv with good home-theater audio , otherwise this tv is suitable for 1000 rs per night hotel rooms \ n",2618.jpg

Keep the machine on hard surface, in such way, that it doesn't budge at all.\n2. Go through the booklet, coming with the product, meticulously, you may yourself install the product. You may also download the pdf from Amazon's page.\n3. If you do it on your own, the only problem you may face is to attach inlet pipe with the tap. There are three detachable parts at the mouth of the inlet pipe (go through the booklet) on the side of the tap. I bought a tap with two stopcock (see the picture) ---- one for washing machine and the other for normal purpose. I have also purchased longer inlet &amp; outlet pipes, as per my requirements, from Amazon (you may get 3 meter or 5 meter lengths of them). Remember, you will have to get everything ready (i.e. provision for electric and water line connection near the machine) before Samsung technician visits your home for demo purpose.\n4. Machine is so superb that it distributes laundry uniformly on its own inside the tub during its operation (rinse / spin), if not (not in my case till now), machine will signal and you may manually balance the same (go through the one page leaflet coming with the product).\n5. The noise produced by the machine is very normal with deep humming sound. In my video, the noise appears to be louder.\n6. Washing and drying quality is very good. I think, for four family members, at best 3 times washing in a week will suffice.\n7. There is a level mark L (low), M (medium) and H (high) inside the tub --- do not overlook for filling the tub with laundry.\n8. Do not mix heavy clothes with light ones for good washing purposes. For example, if you you wish to wash three bed covers, do it separately, and not mix with them with shirts, inners, etc.\n9. Preserve Amazon's voucher carefully, as Samsung technician told me 10 years' warranty on the motor, and any problem cropped up in future, that voucher will be needed.\n10. Only cons ---- consumes huge quantity of water, that I think, is necessary for any top loading washing machine, otherwise, keep electric and water connection on, then, press Power &amp; Start buttons in tandem, machine will work on its own and will signal for end, then goes off automatically, for taking out 90% dried laundry out of it.\n11.

Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\n\nCOMFORT :\n------------\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\n\nLOUDNESS :\n-------------\nCX180 &gt; boAt 225 &gt; JBL CS100SI\n\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\n\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids &amp; lows ) :\n---------------------------------------------\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids &amp; lows, which are strong &amp; Crisp. But bass levels are different.\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\n\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\n----------------------------------\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\nNOTE: boAt &amp; JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\n\nCUSTOMER CARE :\n--------------------\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.\nNOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.\n●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●\n\nCONNECTIVITY :\n------------------\nAll the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.\n\nVERDICT :\n----------\nI don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.\n\nHope this review helps you make sound decision.\n",0,happiness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611Ih04bVxL._SY88.jpg,3,boat 225 vs jbl cs100 vs sennheisers cx180 | detailed comparison after 1 year of use .,"\ n note :\ n there are thousands of reviews for this product , but surprisingly there 's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market . \ n i am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime i also happen to use jbl c100si and sennhesiers cx180 , so i would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review . \ n you get a "" l "" shaped connector in these earphones , so note that . \ n \ ni am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the best earphone in that subtopic , \ n \ nbuilt quality :\ n -

But there is one con if you are buying this for playing songs plzz don't because sound quality is not that great but it is good, but don't worry you can connect your speakers and sub woofer to alexa via aux or Bluetooth.

While the previous gen dot was more of an ""Echo Input"" type functionality, this one can actually serve as a decent speaker. Coming to the software side:\n1. Apple music not supported in India. In fact the only available services are Amazon music, Saavn and Hungama music\n2. Amazon music has a very limited catalog and Indian users can't upload their songs either ( apparently US users can do this)\n3. Spotify not available ""yet""\n4. Youtube/ Google play music not supported for obvious reasons\n5. Because of the above I tried to give Saavn a shot as their catalog is surprisingly large, but then Alexa doesn't support playlists for Saavn.\n\nSummary:\nIf you are planning to get an Echo for listening music - stay away from this (or any Echo device for that matter) - at least for now.\n",1,sadness,1,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51l38mPdXfL._SY88.jpg,4,good hardware marred by limited feature set for indian customers,"\ n upgraded from 2nd to 3rd gen dot , must say the sound quality has improved phenomenally . while the previous gen dot was more of an "" echo input "" type functionality , this one can actually serve as a decent speaker . coming to the software side :\ n1 . apple music not supported in india . in fact the only available services are amazon music , saavn and hungama music \ n2 . amazon music has a very limited catalog and indian users can't upload their songs either ( apparently us users can do this ) \ n3 . spotify not available "" yet "" \ n4 . youtube / google play music not supported for obvious reasons \ n5 . because of the above i tried to give saavn a shot as their catalog is surprisingly large , but then alexa does n't support playlists for saavn . \ n \ nsummary :\ nif you are planning to get an echo for listening music - stay away from this ( or any echo device for that matter ) - at least for now . \ n",3638.jpg
